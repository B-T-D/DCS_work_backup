344     (Supplied by a Late Consumptive Usher to a Grammar School.)
345   
346     The pale Usher—threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; I see him
347     now. He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer
348     handkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the
349     known nations of the world. He loved to dust his old grammars; it
350     somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.
351   
352     “While you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what
353     name a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue, leaving out, through
354     ignorance, the letter H, which almost alone maketh up the
355     signification of the word, you deliver that which is not true.”
356     —_Hackluyt._
357   
358     “WHALE. * * * Sw. and Dan. _hval_. This animal is named from
359     roundness or rolling; for in Dan. _hvalt_ is arched or vaulted.”
360     —_Webster’s Dictionary._
361   
362     “WHALE. * * * It is more immediately from the Dut. and Ger. _Wallen_;
363     A.S. _Walw-ian_, to roll, to wallow.” —_Richardson’s Dictionary._
364

381     EXTRACTS. (Supplied by a Sub-Sub-Librarian).
382   
383   
384   
385     It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of
386     a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long
387     Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random
388     allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever,
389     sacred or profane. Therefore you must not, in every case at least,
390     take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in
391     these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As
392     touching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here
393     appearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as
394     affording a glancing bird’s eye view of what has been promiscuously
395     said, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and
396     generations, including our own.
397   
398     So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am.
399     Thou belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this
400     world will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too
401     rosy-strong; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel
402     poor-devilish, too; and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them
403     bluntly, with full eyes and empty glasses, and in not altogether
404     unpleasant sadness—Give it up, Sub-Subs! For by how much the more
405     pains ye take to please the world, by so much the more shall ye for
406     ever go thankless! Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and the
407     Tuileries for ye! But gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the
408     royal-mast with your hearts; for your friends who have gone before
409     are clearing out the seven-storied heavens, and making refugees of
410     long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael, against your coming.
411     Here ye strike but splintered hearts together—there, ye shall strike
412     unsplinterable glasses!
413   
414   EXTRACTS.

425     play therein.” —_Psalms_.
426   
427     “In that day, the Lord with his sore, and great, and strong sword,
428     shall punish Leviathan the piercing serpent, even Leviathan that
429     crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.”
430     —_Isaiah_.
431   
432     “And what thing soever besides cometh within the chaos of this
433     monster’s mouth, be it beast, boat, or stone, down it goes all
434     incontinently that foul great swallow of his, and perisheth in the
435     bottomless gulf of his paunch.” —_Holland’s Plutarch’s Morals_.
436   
437     “The Indian Sea breedeth the most and the biggest fishes that are:
438     among which the Whales and Whirlpooles called Balaene, take up as
439     much in length as four acres or arpens of land.” —_Holland’s Pliny_.
440   
441     “Scarcely had we proceeded two days on the sea, when about sunrise a
442     great many Whales and other monsters of the sea, appeared. Among the
443     former, one was of a most monstrous size.... This came towards us,
444     open-mouthed, raising the waves on all sides, and beating the sea
445     before him into a foam.” —_Tooke’s Lucian_. “_The True History_.”
446   
447   
448   
449   
450     “He visited this country also with a view of catching horse-whales,
451     which had bones of very great value for their teeth, of which he
452     brought some to the king.... The best whales were catched in his own
453     country, of which some were forty-eight, some fifty yards long. He
454     said that he was one of six who had killed sixty in two days.”
455     —_Other or Other’s verbal narrative taken down from his mouth by King
456     Alfred, A.D._ 890.
457   
458     “And whereas all the other things, whether beast or vessel, that
459     enter into the dreadful gulf of this monster’s (whale’s) mouth, are
460     immediately lost and swallowed up, the sea-gudgeon retires into it in
461     great security, and there sleeps.” —MONTAIGNE. —_Apology for Raimond
462     Sebond_.
463   
464     “Let us fly, let us fly! Old Nick take me if is not Leviathan
465     described by the noble prophet Moses in the life of patient Job.”
466     —_Rabelais_.
467   
468     “This whale’s liver was two cartloads.” —_Stowe’s Annals_.
469   
470     “The great Leviathan that maketh the seas to seethe like boiling
471     pan.” —_Lord Bacon’s Version of the Psalms_.
472   
473     “Touching that monstrous bulk of the whale or ork we have received
474     nothing certain. They grow exceeding fat, insomuch that an incredible
475     quantity of oil will be extracted out of one whale.” —_Ibid_.

477   
478   
479

484     “Very like a whale.” —_Hamlet_.
485   
486   
487     “Which to secure, no skill of leach’s art Mote him availle, but to
488     returne againe To his wound’s worker, that with lowly dart, Dinting
489     his breast, had bred his restless paine, Like as the wounded whale to
490     shore flies thro’ the maine.” —_The Faerie Queen_.
491   
492   
493   
494     “Immense as whales, the motion of whose vast bodies can in a peaceful
495     calm trouble the ocean till it boil.” —_Sir William Davenant. Preface
496     to Gondibert_.
497   
498     “What spermacetti is, men might justly doubt, since the learned
499     Hosmannus in his work of thirty years, saith plainly, _Nescio quid
500     sit_.” —_Sir T. Browne. Of Sperma Ceti and the Sperma Ceti Whale.

502   
503   
504     “Like Spencer’s Talus with his modern flail He threatens ruin with
505     his ponderous tail. ... Their fixed jav’lins in his side he wears,
506     And on his back a grove of pikes appears.” —_Waller’s Battle of the
507     Summer Islands_.
508   
509   
510   
511     “By art is created that great Leviathan, called a Commonwealth or
512     State—(in Latin, Civitas) which is but an artificial man.” —_Opening
513     sentence of Hobbes’s Leviathan_.
514   
515     “Silly Mansoul swallowed it without chewing, as if it had been a
516     sprat in the mouth of a whale.” —_Pilgrim’s Progress_.

519     “That sea beast Leviathan, which God of all his works Created hugest

555     they can see a whale, for the first discoverer has a ducat for his
556     pains.... I was told of a whale taken near Shetland, that had above a

849   CHAPTER 1. Loomings.
850   
851   Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having
852   little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me
853   on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part
854   of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and
855   regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about
856   the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever
857   I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and
858   bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever
859   my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral
860   principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and
861   methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to
862   get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball.
863   With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I
864   quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they
865   but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other,
866   cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
867   
868   There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by
869   wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her
870   surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme
871   downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and
872   cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of
873   land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.
874   
875   Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears
876   Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What
877   do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand
878   thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some
879   leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some
880   looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the
881   rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these
882   are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to
883   counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are
884   the green fields gone? What do they here?
885   
886   But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and
887   seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the
888   extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder
889   warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water
890   as they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand—miles of
891   them—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets
892   and avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell
893   me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all
894   those ships attract them thither?
895   
896   Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take
897   almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a
898   dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in
899   it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest
900   reveries—stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will
901   infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.
902   Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this
903   experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical
904   professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for
905   ever.
906   
907   But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,
908   quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley
909   of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his
910   trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were
911   within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up
912   from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands
913   winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in
914   their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and
915   though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this
916   shepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were
917   fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June,
918   when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among
919   Tiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a drop
920   of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel
921   your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon
922   suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy
923   him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian
924   trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a
925   robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?
926   Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a
927   mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out
928   of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did
929   the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely
930   all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that
931   story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild
932   image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that
933   same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image
934   of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.
935   
936   Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin
937   to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my
938   lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a
939   passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a
940   purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers
941   get sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do not enjoy
942   themselves much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a passenger;
943   nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a
944   Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction
945   of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all
946   honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind
947   whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,
948   without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.
949   And as for going as cook,—though I confess there is considerable glory
950   in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I
951   never fancied broiling fowls;—though once broiled, judiciously
952   buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who
953   will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled
954   fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old
955   Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the
956   mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.
957   
958   No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,
959   plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.
960   True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to
961   spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of
962   thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one’s sense of honor,
963   particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the
964   Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if
965   just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been
966   lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in
967   awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a
968   schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and
969   the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off
970   in time.
971   
972   What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom
973   and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed,
974   I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel
975   Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and
976   respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain’t
977   a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may
978   order me about—however they may thump and punch me about, I have the
979   satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is
980   one way or other served in much the same way—either in a physical or
981   metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is
982   passed round, and all hands should rub each other’s shoulder-blades,
983   and be content.
984   
985   Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of
986   paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single
987   penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must
988   pay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and
989   being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable
990   infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But _being
991   paid_,—what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man
992   receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly
993   believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no
994   account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign
995   ourselves to perdition!
996   
997   Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome
998   exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world,
999   head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if
1000  you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the
1001  Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from
1002  the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not
1003  so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many
1004  other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But
1005  wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a
1006  merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling
1007  voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the
1008  constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in
1009  some unaccountable way—he can better answer than any one else. And,
1010  doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand
1011  programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in
1012  as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive
1013  performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run
1014  something like this:
1015  
1016  “_Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States._
1017  “WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”
1018  
1019  Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the
1020  Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when
1021  others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short
1022  and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces—though I
1023  cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the
1024  circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives
1025  which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced
1026  me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the
1027  delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill
1028  and discriminating judgment.
1029  
1030  Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale
1031  himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my
1032  curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island
1033  bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all
1034  the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds,
1035  helped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things
1036  would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an
1037  everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and
1038  land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to
1039  perceive a horror, and could still be social with it—would they let
1040  me—since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of
1041  the place one lodges in.
1042  
1043  By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the
1044  great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild
1045  conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into
1046  my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them
1047  all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.
1048  
1049  
1050  CHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.
1051  
1052  I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my
1053  arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city
1054  of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night
1055  in December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little
1056  packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching
1057  that place would offer, till the following Monday.
1058  
1059  As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at
1060  this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well
1061  be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was
1062  made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a
1063  fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous
1064  old island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has
1065  of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though
1066  in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket
1067  was her great original—the Tyre of this Carthage;—the place where the
1068  first dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket
1069  did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes
1070  to give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did
1071  that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with
1072  imported cobblestones—so goes the story—to throw at the whales, in
1073  order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the
1074  bowsprit?
1075  
1076  Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me
1077  in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a
1078  matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a
1079  very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold
1080  and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had
1081  sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,—So,
1082  wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of
1083  a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the
1084  north with the darkness towards the south—wherever in your wisdom you
1085  may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to
1086  inquire the price, and don’t be too particular.
1087  
1088  With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of “The
1089  Crossed Harpoons”—but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further
1090  on, from the bright red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn,” there came
1091  such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and
1092  ice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay
1093  ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,—rather weary for me,
1094  when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from
1095  hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most
1096  miserable plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one
1097  moment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of
1098  the tinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don’t
1099  you hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots are
1100  stopping the way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the streets
1101  that took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not
1102  the cheeriest inns.
1103  
1104  Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,
1105  and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At
1106  this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of
1107  the town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light
1108  proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood
1109  invitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the
1110  uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble
1111  over an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying
1112  particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city,
1113  Gomorrah? But “The Crossed Harpoons,” and “The Sword-Fish?”—this, then
1114  must needs be the sign of “The Trap.” However, I picked myself up and
1115  hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior
1116  door.
1117  
1118  It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black
1119  faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of
1120  Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the
1121  preacher’s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping
1122  and wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing
1123  out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of ‘The Trap!’
1124  
1125  Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the
1126  docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a
1127  swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly
1128  representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words
1129  underneath—“The Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”
1130  
1131  Coffin?—Spouter?—Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought
1132  I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this
1133  Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and
1134  the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated
1135  little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here
1136  from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a
1137  poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very
1138  spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.
1139  
1140  It was a queer sort of place—a gable-ended old house, one side palsied
1141  as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner,
1142  where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than
1143  ever it did about poor Paul’s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless,
1144  is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the
1145  hob quietly toasting for bed. “In judging of that tempestuous wind
1146  called Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose works I possess the
1147  only copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou
1148  lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the
1149  outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where
1150  the frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only
1151  glazier.” True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my
1152  mind—old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are
1153  windows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn’t
1154  stop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint
1155  here and there. But it’s too late to make any improvements now. The
1156  universe is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted
1157  off a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth
1158  against the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with
1159  his shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a
1160  corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the
1161  tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken
1162  wrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty
1163  night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of their
1164  oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the
1165  privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.
1166  
1167  But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up
1168  to the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra
1169  than here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the
1170  line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in
1171  order to keep out this frost?
1172  
1173  Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the
1174  door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be
1175  moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a
1176  Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a
1177  temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.
1178  
1179  But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there
1180  is plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted
1181  feet, and see what sort of a place this “Spouter” may be.
1182  
1183  
1184  CHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.
1185  
1186  Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,
1187  low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of
1188  the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large
1189  oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the
1190  unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent
1191  study and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of
1192  the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its
1193  purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first
1194  you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New
1195  England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint
1196  of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and
1197  especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the
1198  entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however
1199  wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.
1200  
1201  But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,
1202  portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the
1203  picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a
1204  nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive
1205  a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite,
1206  half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to
1207  it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what
1208  that marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas,
1209  deceptive idea would dart you through.—It’s the Black Sea in a midnight
1210  gale.—It’s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.—It’s a
1211  blasted heath.—It’s a Hyperborean winter scene.—It’s the breaking-up of
1212  the icebound stream of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to
1213  that one portentous something in the picture’s midst. _That_ once found
1214  out, and all the rest were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint
1215  resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself?
1216  
1217  In fact, the artist’s design seemed this: a final theory of my own,
1218  partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with
1219  whom I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner
1220  in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its
1221  three dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale,
1222  purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of
1223  impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.
1224  
1225  The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish
1226  array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with
1227  glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots
1228  of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping
1229  round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed
1230  mower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal
1231  and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking,
1232  horrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances
1233  and harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With
1234  this once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan
1235  Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that
1236  harpoon—so like a corkscrew now—was flung in Javan seas, and run away
1237  with by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The
1238  original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle
1239  sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last
1240  was found imbedded in the hump.
1241  
1242  Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way—cut
1243  through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with
1244  fireplaces all round—you enter the public room. A still duskier place
1245  is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled
1246  planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft’s
1247  cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored
1248  old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like
1249  table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities
1250  gathered from this wide world’s remotest nooks. Projecting from the
1251  further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den—the bar—a rude
1252  attempt at a right whale’s head. Be that how it may, there stands the
1253  vast arched bone of the whale’s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost
1254  drive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old
1255  decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction,
1256  like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him),
1257  bustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells
1258  the sailors deliriums and death.
1259  
1260  Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true
1261  cylinders without—within, the villanous green goggling glasses
1262  deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians
1263  rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads’ goblets. Fill to
1264  _this_ mark, and your charge is but a penny; to _this_ a penny more;
1265  and so on to the full glass—the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp
1266  down for a shilling.
1267  
1268  Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about
1269  a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of _skrimshander_. I
1270  sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with
1271  a room, received for answer that his house was full—not a bed
1272  unoccupied. “But avast,” he added, tapping his forehead, “you haint no
1273  objections to sharing a harpooneer’s blanket, have ye? I s’pose you are
1274  goin’ a-whalin’, so you’d better get used to that sort of thing.”
1275  
1276  I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should
1277  ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that
1278  if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the
1279  harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander
1280  further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with
1281  the half of any decent man’s blanket.
1282  
1283  “I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?—you want supper?
1284  Supper’ll be ready directly.”
1285  
1286  I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the
1287  Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with
1288  his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space
1289  between his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but
1290  he didn’t make much headway, I thought.
1291  
1292  At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an
1293  adjoining room. It was cold as Iceland—no fire at all—the landlord said
1294  he couldn’t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a
1295  winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold
1296  to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the
1297  fare was of the most substantial kind—not only meat and potatoes, but
1298  dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a
1299  green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful
1300  manner.
1301  
1302  “My boy,” said the landlord, “you’ll have the nightmare to a dead
1303  sartainty.”
1304  
1305  “Landlord,” I whispered, “that aint the harpooneer is it?”
1306  
1307  “Oh, no,” said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, “the
1308  harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he
1309  don’t—he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes ’em rare.”
1310  
1311  “The devil he does,” says I. “Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?”
1312  
1313  “He’ll be here afore long,” was the answer.
1314  
1315  I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this “dark
1316  complexioned” harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so
1317  turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into
1318  bed before I did.
1319  
1320  Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not
1321  what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the
1322  evening as a looker on.
1323  
1324  Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord
1325  cried, “That’s the Grampus’s crew. I seed her reported in the offing
1326  this morning; a three years’ voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now
1327  we’ll have the latest news from the Feegees.”
1328  
1329  A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung
1330  open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their
1331  shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters,
1332  all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they
1333  seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from
1334  their boat, and this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then,
1335  that they made a straight wake for the whale’s mouth—the bar—when the
1336  wrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out
1337  brimmers all round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon
1338  which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he
1339  swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never
1340  mind of how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador,
1341  or on the weather side of an ice-island.
1342  
1343  The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even
1344  with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began
1345  capering about most obstreperously.
1346  
1347  I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though
1348  he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his
1349  own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much
1350  noise as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the
1351  sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though
1352  but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I
1353  will here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six
1354  feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I
1355  have seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and
1356  burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the
1357  deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem
1358  to give him much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a
1359  Southerner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of
1360  those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When
1361  the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man
1362  slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my
1363  comrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his
1364  shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with
1365  them, they raised a cry of “Bulkington! Bulkington! where’s
1366  Bulkington?” and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.
1367  
1368  It was now about nine o’clock, and the room seeming almost
1369  supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself
1370  upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the
1371  entrance of the seamen.
1372  
1373  No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal
1374  rather not sleep with your own brother. I don’t know how it is, but
1375  people like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to
1376  sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town,
1377  and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely
1378  multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should
1379  sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep
1380  two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all
1381  sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and
1382  cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.
1383  
1384  The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the
1385  thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a
1386  harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of
1387  the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.
1388  Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home
1389  and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at
1390  midnight—how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?
1391  
1392  “Landlord! I’ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.—I shan’t sleep
1393  with him. I’ll try the bench here.”
1394  
1395  “Just as you please; I’m sorry I can’t spare ye a tablecloth for a
1396  mattress, and it’s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling of the knots and
1397  notches. “But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I’ve got a carpenter’s plane
1398  there in the bar—wait, I say, and I’ll make ye snug enough.” So saying
1399  he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting
1400  the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning
1401  like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the
1402  plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was
1403  near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven’s sake to quit—the
1404  bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing
1405  in the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the
1406  shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in
1407  the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a
1408  brown study.
1409  
1410  I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too
1411  short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too
1412  narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher
1413  than the planed one—so there was no yoking them. I then placed the
1414  first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,
1415  leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I
1416  soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from
1417  under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all,
1418  especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from
1419  the window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in
1420  the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the
1421  night.
1422  
1423  The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn’t I steal
1424  a march on him—bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be
1425  wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon
1426  second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next
1427  morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be
1428  standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!
1429  
1430  Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of
1431  spending a sufferable night unless in some other person’s bed, I began
1432  to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices
1433  against this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I’ll wait awhile; he must be
1434  dropping in before long. I’ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps
1435  we may become jolly good bedfellows after all—there’s no telling.
1436  
1437  But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,
1438  and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.
1439  
1440  “Landlord!” said I, “what sort of a chap is he—does he always keep such
1441  late hours?” It was now hard upon twelve o’clock.
1442  
1443  The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be
1444  mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. “No,” he
1445  answered, “generally he’s an early bird—airley to bed and airley to
1446  rise—yes, he’s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out
1447  a peddling, you see, and I don’t see what on airth keeps him so late,
1448  unless, may be, he can’t sell his head.”
1449  
1450  “Can’t sell his head?—What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are
1451  telling me?” getting into a towering rage. “Do you pretend to say,
1452  landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed
1453  Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around
1454  this town?”
1455  
1456  “That’s precisely it,” said the landlord, “and I told him he couldn’t
1457  sell it here, the market’s overstocked.”
1458  
1459  “With what?” shouted I.
1460  
1461  “With heads to be sure; ain’t there too many heads in the world?”
1462  
1463  “I tell you what it is, landlord,” said I quite calmly, “you’d better
1464  stop spinning that yarn to me—I’m not green.”
1465  
1466  “May be not,” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, “but I
1467  rayther guess you’ll be done _brown_ if that ere harpooneer hears you a
1468  slanderin’ his head.”
1469  
1470  “I’ll break it for him,” said I, now flying into a passion again at
1471  this unaccountable farrago of the landlord’s.
1472  
1473  “It’s broke a’ready,” said he.
1474  
1475  “Broke,” said I—“_broke_, do you mean?”
1476  
1477  “Sartain, and that’s the very reason he can’t sell it, I guess.”
1478  
1479  “Landlord,” said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a
1480  snow-storm—“landlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one
1481  another, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a
1482  bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half
1483  belongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have
1484  not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and
1485  exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling
1486  towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow—a sort of connexion,
1487  landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest
1488  degree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this
1489  harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the
1490  night with him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay
1491  that story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good
1492  evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I’ve no idea of
1493  sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, _you_ I mean, landlord, _you_,
1494  sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render
1495  yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.”
1496  
1497  “Wall,” said the landlord, fetching a long breath, “that’s a purty long
1498  sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be
1499  easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin’ you of has just arrived
1500  from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of ’balmed New Zealand
1501  heads (great curios, you know), and he’s sold all on ’em but one, and
1502  that one he’s trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow’s Sunday, and it
1503  would not do to be sellin’ human heads about the streets when folks is
1504  goin’ to churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as
1505  he was goin’ out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for
1506  all the airth like a string of inions.”
1507  
1508  This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed
1509  that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me—but at the
1510  same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a
1511  Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal
1512  business as selling the heads of dead idolators?
1513  
1514  “Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.”
1515  
1516  “He pays reg’lar,” was the rejoinder. “But come, it’s getting dreadful
1517  late, you had better be turning flukes—it’s a nice bed; Sal and me
1518  slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There’s plenty of room
1519  for two to kick about in that bed; it’s an almighty big bed that. Why,
1520  afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the
1521  foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and
1522  somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm.
1523  Arter that, Sal said it wouldn’t do. Come along here, I’ll give ye a
1524  glim in a jiffy;” and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards
1525  me, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a
1526  clock in the corner, he exclaimed “I vum it’s Sunday—you won’t see that
1527  harpooneer to-night; he’s come to anchor somewhere—come along then;
1528  _do_ come; _won’t_ ye come?”
1529  
1530  I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was
1531  ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,
1532  with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four
1533  harpooneers to sleep abreast.
1534  
1535  “There,” said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest
1536  that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; “there, make
1537  yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.” I turned round from
1538  eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.
1539  
1540  Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of
1541  the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then
1542  glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,
1543  could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf,
1544  the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a
1545  whale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a
1546  hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a
1547  large seaman’s bag, containing the harpooneer’s wardrobe, no doubt in
1548  lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone
1549  fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon
1550  standing at the head of the bed.
1551  
1552  But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the
1553  light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to
1554  arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it
1555  to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little
1556  tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an
1557  Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as
1558  you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible
1559  that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the
1560  streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to
1561  try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy
1562  and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious
1563  harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit
1564  of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my
1565  life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink
1566  in the neck.
1567  
1568  I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this
1569  head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on
1570  the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in
1571  the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a
1572  little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now,
1573  half undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about
1574  the harpooneer’s not coming home at all that night, it being so very
1575  late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots,
1576  and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself
1577  to the care of heaven.
1578  
1579  Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,
1580  there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not
1581  sleep for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had
1582  pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard
1583  a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into
1584  the room from under the door.
1585  
1586  Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal
1587  head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word
1588  till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New
1589  Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without
1590  looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on
1591  the floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted
1592  cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was
1593  all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time
1594  while employed in unlacing the bag’s mouth. This accomplished, however,
1595  he turned round—when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was
1596  of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with
1597  large blackish looking squares. Yes, it’s just as I thought, he’s a
1598  terrible bedfellow; he’s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here
1599  he is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his
1600  face so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be
1601  sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were
1602  stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this;
1603  but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story
1604  of a white man—a whaleman too—who, falling among the cannibals, had
1605  been tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course
1606  of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And
1607  what is it, thought I, after all! It’s only his outside; a man can be
1608  honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly
1609  complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely
1610  independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be
1611  nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot
1612  sun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had
1613  never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these
1614  extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were
1615  passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at
1616  all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced
1617  fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a
1618  seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in
1619  the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly
1620  thing enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his
1621  hat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.
1622  There was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing but a
1623  small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now
1624  looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger
1625  stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker
1626  than ever I bolted a dinner.
1627  
1628  Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but
1629  it was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this
1630  head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.
1631  Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and
1632  confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of
1633  him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at
1634  the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game
1635  enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer
1636  concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.
1637  
1638  Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed
1639  his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were
1640  checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all
1641  over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years’
1642  War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still
1643  more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs
1644  were running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that
1645  he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman
1646  in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to
1647  think of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps the heads of his own
1648  brothers. He might take a fancy to mine—heavens! look at that tomahawk!
1649  
1650  But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about
1651  something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me
1652  that he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall,
1653  or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in
1654  the pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image
1655  with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days’ old
1656  Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought
1657  that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar
1658  manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened
1659  a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing
1660  but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage
1661  goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board,
1662  sets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the
1663  andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty,
1664  so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine
1665  or chapel for his Congo idol.
1666  
1667  I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but
1668  ill at ease meantime—to see what was next to follow. First he takes
1669  about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places
1670  them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on
1671  top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into
1672  a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the
1673  fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed
1674  to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the
1675  biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite
1676  offer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to
1677  fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these
1678  strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from
1679  the devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing
1680  some pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in
1681  the most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the
1682  idol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket
1683  as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.
1684  
1685  All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing
1686  him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business
1687  operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,
1688  now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which
1689  I had so long been bound.
1690  
1691  But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.
1692  Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for
1693  an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the
1694  handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment
1695  the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between
1696  his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it
1697  now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.
1698  
1699  Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him
1700  against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might
1701  be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his
1702  guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my
1703  meaning.
1704  
1705  “Who-e debel you?”—he at last said—“you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.”
1706  And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the
1707  dark.
1708  
1709  “Landlord, for God’s sake, Peter Coffin!” shouted I. “Landlord! Watch!
1710  Coffin! Angels! save me!”
1711  
1712  “Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!” again growled the
1713  cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the
1714  hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire.
1715  But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light
1716  in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.
1717  
1718  “Don’t be afraid now,” said he, grinning again, “Queequeg here wouldn’t
1719  harm a hair of your head.”
1720  
1721  “Stop your grinning,” shouted I, “and why didn’t you tell me that that
1722  infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?”
1723  
1724  “I thought ye know’d it;—didn’t I tell ye, he was a peddlin’ heads
1725  around town?—but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look
1726  here—you sabbee me, I sabbee—you this man sleepe you—you sabbee?”
1727  
1728  “Me sabbee plenty”—grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and
1729  sitting up in bed.
1730  
1731  “You gettee in,” he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and
1732  throwing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a
1733  civil but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a
1734  moment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely
1735  looking cannibal. What’s all this fuss I have been making about,
1736  thought I to myself—the man’s a human being just as I am: he has just
1737  as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep
1738  with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.
1739  
1740  “Landlord,” said I, “tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or
1741  whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will
1742  turn in with him. But I don’t fancy having a man smoking in bed with
1743  me. It’s dangerous. Besides, I ain’t insured.”
1744  
1745  This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely
1746  motioned me to get into bed—rolling over to one side as much as to
1747  say—“I won’t touch a leg of ye.”
1748  
1749  “Good night, landlord,” said I, “you may go.”
1750  
1751  I turned in, and never slept better in my life.
1752  
1753  
1754  CHAPTER 4. The Counterpane.
1755  
1756  Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg’s arm thrown
1757  over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost
1758  thought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of
1759  odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his
1760  tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no
1761  two parts of which were of one precise shade—owing I suppose to his
1762  keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt
1763  sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times—this same arm of his, I
1764  say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork
1765  quilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I
1766  could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues
1767  together; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I
1768  could tell that Queequeg was hugging me.
1769  
1770  My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a
1771  child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;
1772  whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The
1773  circumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other—I
1774  think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little
1775  sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,
1776  was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,—my
1777  mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to
1778  bed, though it was only two o’clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,
1779  the longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But
1780  there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the
1781  third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,
1782  and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.
1783  
1784  I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse
1785  before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small
1786  of my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun
1787  shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the
1788  streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse
1789  and worse—at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my
1790  stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at
1791  her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good
1792  slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to
1793  lie abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and
1794  most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For
1795  several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than
1796  I have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes.
1797  At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and
1798  slowly waking from it—half steeped in dreams—I opened my eyes, and the
1799  before sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt
1800  a shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and
1801  nothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.
1802  My arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable,
1803  silent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely
1804  seated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there,
1805  frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet
1806  ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid
1807  spell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided
1808  away from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it
1809  all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in
1810  confounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I
1811  often puzzle myself with it.
1812  
1813  Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the
1814  supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to
1815  those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg’s pagan arm
1816  thrown round me. But at length all the past night’s events soberly
1817  recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to
1818  the comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm—unlock his
1819  bridegroom clasp—yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,
1820  as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse
1821  him—“Queequeg!”—but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over, my
1822  neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a
1823  slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk
1824  sleeping by the savage’s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A
1825  pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the
1826  broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! “Queequeg!—in the name of
1827  goodness, Queequeg, wake!” At length, by dint of much wriggling, and
1828  loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his
1829  hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in
1830  extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself
1831  all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in
1832  bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if
1833  he did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim
1834  consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over
1835  him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings
1836  now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at
1837  last, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,
1838  and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon
1839  the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,
1840  if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress
1841  afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,
1842  under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the
1843  truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you
1844  will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this
1845  particular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much
1846  civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;
1847  staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for
1848  the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless,
1849  a man like Queequeg you don’t see every day, he and his ways were well
1850  worth unusual regarding.
1851  
1852  He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall
1853  one, by the by, and then—still minus his trowsers—he hunted up his
1854  boots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his
1855  next movement was to crush himself—boots in hand, and hat on—under the
1856  bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he
1857  was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I
1858  ever heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his
1859  boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition
1860  stage—neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized
1861  to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His
1862  education was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not
1863  been a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled
1864  himself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,
1865  he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At
1866  last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over
1867  his eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not
1868  being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide
1869  ones—probably not made to order either—rather pinched and tormented him
1870  at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.
1871  
1872  Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the
1873  street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view
1874  into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that
1875  Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on;
1876  I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and
1877  particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He
1878  complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the
1879  morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my
1880  amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his
1881  chest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a
1882  piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water
1883  and commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept
1884  his razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed
1885  corner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it
1886  a little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the
1887  wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.
1888  Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers’s best cutlery with a
1889  vengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came
1890  to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how
1891  exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.
1892  
1893  The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of
1894  the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his
1895  harpoon like a marshal’s baton.
1896  
1897  
1898  CHAPTER 5. Breakfast.
1899  
1900  I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the
1901  grinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him,
1902  though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my
1903  bedfellow.
1904  
1905  However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a
1906  good thing; the more’s the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper
1907  person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be
1908  backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in
1909  that way. And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about
1910  him, be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for.
1911  
1912  The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the
1913  night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were
1914  nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates,
1915  and sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and
1916  harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky
1917  beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning
1918  gowns.
1919  
1920  You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This
1921  young fellow’s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and
1922  would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days
1923  landed from his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades
1924  lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the
1925  complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly
1926  bleached withal; _he_ doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But who
1927  could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints,
1928  seemed like the Andes’ western slope, to show forth in one array,
1929  contrasting climates, zone by zone.
1930  
1931  “Grub, ho!” now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we
1932  went to breakfast.
1933  
1934  They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease
1935  in manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though:
1936  Ledyard, the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch
1937  one; of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor. But
1938  perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as
1939  Ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in
1940  the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo’s
1941  performances—this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best mode
1942  of attaining a high social polish. Still, for the most part, that sort
1943  of thing is to be had anywhere.
1944  
1945  These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that
1946  after we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some
1947  good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man
1948  maintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked
1949  embarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the
1950  slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas—entire
1951  strangers to them—and duelled them dead without winking; and yet, here
1952  they sat at a social breakfast table—all of the same calling, all of
1953  kindred tastes—looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they
1954  had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green
1955  Mountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior
1956  whalemen!
1957  
1958  But as for Queequeg—why, Queequeg sat there among them—at the head of
1959  the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I
1960  cannot say much for his breeding. His greatest admirer could not have
1961  cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him,
1962  and using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it,
1963  to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks
1964  towards him. But _that_ was certainly very coolly done by him, and
1965  every one knows that in most people’s estimation, to do anything coolly
1966  is to do it genteelly.
1967  
1968  We will not speak of all Queequeg’s peculiarities here; how he eschewed
1969  coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to
1970  beefsteaks, done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew
1971  like the rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was
1972  sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat
1973  on, when I sallied out for a stroll.
1974  
1975  
1976  CHAPTER 6. The Street.
1977  
1978  If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish
1979  an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a
1980  civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first
1981  daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.
1982  
1983  In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will
1984  frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign
1985  parts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners
1986  will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not
1987  unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live
1988  Yankees have often scared the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water
1989  Street and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts you see only
1990  sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street
1991  corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy
1992  flesh. It makes a stranger stare.
1993  
1994  But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians,
1995  and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft
1996  which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still
1997  more curious, certainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town
1998  scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain
1999  and glory in the fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames;
2000  fellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and
2001  snatch the whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence
2002  they came. In some things you would think them but a few hours old.
2003  Look there! that chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat
2004  and swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife.
2005  Here comes another with a sou’-wester and a bombazine cloak.
2006  
2007  No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one—I mean a
2008  downright bumpkin dandy—a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his
2009  two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a
2010  country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished
2011  reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the
2012  comical things he does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his
2013  sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his
2014  canvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those
2015  straps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps,
2016  buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.
2017  
2018  But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals,
2019  and bumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a
2020  queer place. Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would
2021  this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of
2022  Labrador. As it is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten
2023  one, they look so bony. The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to
2024  live in, in all New England. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not
2025  like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run
2026  with milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs.
2027  Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America will you find more
2028  patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New
2029  Bedford. Whence came they? how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of
2030  a country?
2031  
2032  Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty
2033  mansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave
2034  houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian
2035  oceans. One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the
2036  bottom of the sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?
2037  
2038  In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their
2039  daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece.
2040  You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say,
2041  they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly
2042  burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.
2043  
2044  In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples—long
2045  avenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful
2046  and bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by
2047  their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is
2048  art; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright
2049  terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at
2050  creation’s final day.
2051  
2052  And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But
2053  roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks
2054  is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that
2055  bloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young
2056  girls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off
2057  shore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of
2058  the Puritanic sands.
2059  
2060  
2061  CHAPTER 7. The Chapel.
2062  
2063  In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman’s Chapel, and few are
2064  the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who
2065  fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot. I am sure that I did not.
2066  
2067  Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this
2068  special errand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving
2069  sleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called
2070  bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm. Entering, I found
2071  a small scattered congregation of sailors, and sailors’ wives and
2072  widows. A muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks
2073  of the storm. Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart
2074  from the other, as if each silent grief were insular and
2075  incommunicable. The chaplain had not yet arrived; and there these
2076  silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble
2077  tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on either side the
2078  pulpit. Three of them ran something like the following, but I do not
2079  pretend to quote:—
2080  
2081  SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT, Who, at the age of eighteen, was
2082  lost overboard, Near the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia, _November_
2083  1_st_, 1836. THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS SISTER.
2084  
2085  SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN,
2086  WALTER CANNY, SETH MACY, AND SAMUEL GLEIG, Forming one of the boats’
2087  crews OF THE SHIP ELIZA Who were towed out of sight by a Whale, On the
2088  Off-shore Ground in the PACIFIC, _December_ 31_st_, 1839. THIS MARBLE
2089  Is here placed by their surviving SHIPMATES.
2090  
2091  SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY, Who in the bows
2092  of his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan, _August_
2093  3_d_, 1833. THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS WIDOW.
2094  
2095  Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated
2096  myself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see
2097  Queequeg near me. Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a
2098  wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance. This savage
2099  was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance; because
2100  he was the only one who could not read, and, therefore, was not reading
2101  those frigid inscriptions on the wall. Whether any of the relatives of
2102  the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation,
2103  I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery,
2104  and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not
2105  the trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here
2106  before me were assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of
2107  those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed
2108  afresh.
2109  
2110  Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing
2111  among flowers can say—here, _here_ lies my beloved; ye know not the
2112  desolation that broods in bosoms like these. What bitter blanks in
2113  those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes! What despair in
2114  those immovable inscriptions! What deadly voids and unbidden
2115  infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse
2116  resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a
2117  grave. As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as
2118  here.
2119  
2120  In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included;
2121  why it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no
2122  tales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it is
2123  that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefix
2124  so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if
2125  he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth; why the
2126  Life Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals; in what
2127  eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies
2128  antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago; how it is that we
2129  still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are
2130  dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all
2131  the dead; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify
2132  a whole city. All these things are not without their meanings.
2133  
2134  But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these
2135  dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.
2136  
2137  It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a
2138  Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky
2139  light of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who
2140  had gone before me. Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But
2141  somehow I grew merry again. Delightful inducements to embark, fine
2142  chance for promotion, it seems—aye, a stove boat will make me an
2143  immortal by brevet. Yes, there is death in this business of whaling—a
2144  speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what
2145  then? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death.
2146  Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true
2147  substance. Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too
2148  much like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking
2149  that thick water the thinnest of air. Methinks my body is but the lees
2150  of my better being. In fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is
2151  not me. And therefore three cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat
2152  and stove body when they will, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.
2153  
2154  
2155  CHAPTER 8. The Pulpit.
2156  
2157  I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable
2158  robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon
2159  admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation,
2160  sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it
2161  was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he
2162  was a very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in
2163  his youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the
2164  ministry. At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy
2165  winter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging
2166  into a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his
2167  wrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing
2168  bloom—the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February’s snow. No
2169  one having previously heard his history, could for the first time
2170  behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest, because there were
2171  certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that
2172  adventurous maritime life he had led. When he entered I observed that
2173  he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for
2174  his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot
2175  cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of
2176  the water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one
2177  by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner;
2178  when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.
2179  
2180  Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a
2181  regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the
2182  floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the
2183  architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and
2184  finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side
2185  ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife
2186  of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of
2187  red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely
2188  headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance,
2189  considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad
2190  taste. Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both
2191  hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple
2192  cast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor-like but still
2193  reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if
2194  ascending the main-top of his vessel.
2195  
2196  The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case
2197  with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of
2198  wood, so that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of
2199  the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship,
2200  these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not
2201  prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn
2202  round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder
2203  step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him
2204  impregnable in his little Quebec.
2205  
2206  I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.
2207  Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and
2208  sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any
2209  mere tricks of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober
2210  reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen.
2211  Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies
2212  his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties
2213  and connexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the
2214  word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a
2215  self-containing stronghold—a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial
2216  well of water within the walls.
2217  
2218  But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,
2219  borrowed from the chaplain’s former sea-farings. Between the marble
2220  cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back
2221  was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating
2222  against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy
2223  breakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there
2224  floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel’s
2225  face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the
2226  ship’s tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into
2227  the Victory’s plank where Nelson fell. “Ah, noble ship,” the angel
2228  seemed to say, “beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy
2229  helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling
2230  off—serenest azure is at hand.”
2231  
2232  Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that
2233  had achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in the
2234  likeness of a ship’s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a
2235  projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship’s fiddle-headed
2236  beak.
2237  
2238  What could be more full of meaning?—for the pulpit is ever this earth’s
2239  foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the
2240  world. From thence it is the storm of God’s quick wrath is first
2241  descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence it is
2242  the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds.
2243  Yes, the world’s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete;
2244  and the pulpit is its prow.
2245  
2246  
2247  CHAPTER 9. The Sermon.
2248  
2249  Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered
2250  the scattered people to condense. “Starboard gangway, there! side away
2251  to larboard—larboard gangway to starboard! Midships! midships!”
2252  
2253  There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a
2254  still slighter shuffling of women’s shoes, and all was quiet again, and
2255  every eye on the preacher.
2256  
2257  He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit’s bows, folded his
2258  large brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and
2259  offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying
2260  at the bottom of the sea.
2261  
2262  This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a
2263  bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog—in such tones he
2264  commenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards
2265  the concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy—
2266  
2267  
2268    “The ribs and terrors in the whale, Arched over me a dismal gloom,
2269    While all God’s sun-lit waves rolled by, And lift me deepening down
2270    to doom.
2271  
2272    “I saw the opening maw of hell, With endless pains and sorrows there;
2273    Which none but they that feel can tell— Oh, I was plunging to
2274    despair.
2275  
2276    “In black distress, I called my God, When I could scarce believe him
2277    mine, He bowed his ear to my complaints— No more the whale did me
2278    confine.
2279  
2280    “With speed he flew to my relief, As on a radiant dolphin borne;
2281    Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone The face of my Deliverer God.
2282  
2283    “My song for ever shall record That terrible, that joyful hour; I
2284    give the glory to my God, His all the mercy and the power.”
2285  
2286  
2287  
2288  
2289  Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the
2290  howling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned
2291  over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon
2292  the proper page, said: “Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the
2293  first chapter of Jonah—‘And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up
2294  Jonah.’”
2295  
2296  “Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters—four yarns—is one
2297  of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet what
2298  depths of the soul does Jonah’s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant
2299  lesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in
2300  the fish’s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the
2301  floods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the
2302  waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But _what_
2303  is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a
2304  two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to
2305  me as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us
2306  all, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly
2307  awakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally
2308  the deliverance and joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the
2309  sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the
2310  command of God—never mind now what that command was, or how
2311  conveyed—which he found a hard command. But all the things that God
2312  would have us do are hard for us to do—remember that—and hence, he
2313  oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we
2314  must disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein
2315  the hardness of obeying God consists.
2316  
2317  “With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at
2318  God, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men
2319  will carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the
2320  Captains of this earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks
2321  a ship that’s bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto
2322  unheeded meaning here. By all accounts Tarshish could have been no
2323  other city than the modern Cadiz. That’s the opinion of learned men.
2324  And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from
2325  Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when
2326  the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern
2327  Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean,
2328  the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the
2329  westward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye not
2330  then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God?
2331  Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with
2332  slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the
2333  shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. So
2334  disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen
2335  in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had
2336  been arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he’s a fugitive! no
2337  baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,—no friends accompany him
2338  to the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he
2339  finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as
2340  he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for
2341  the moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger’s
2342  evil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and
2343  confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the
2344  man assure the mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but
2345  still serious way, one whispers to the other—“Jack, he’s robbed a
2346  widow;” or, “Joe, do you mark him; he’s a bigamist;” or, “Harry lad, I
2347  guess he’s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike,
2348  one of the missing murderers from Sodom.” Another runs to read the bill
2349  that’s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is
2350  moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a
2351  parricide, and containing a description of his person. He reads, and
2352  looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now
2353  crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah
2354  trembles, and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so
2355  much the more a coward. He will not confess himself suspected; but that
2356  itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and when the
2357  sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him
2358  pass, and he descends into the cabin.
2359  
2360  “‘Who’s there?’ cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making
2361  out his papers for the Customs—‘Who’s there?’ Oh! how that harmless
2362  question mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again.
2363  But he rallies. ‘I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon
2364  sail ye, sir?’ Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah,
2365  though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that
2366  hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. ‘We sail with the
2367  next coming tide,’ at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing
2368  him. ‘No sooner, sir?’—‘Soon enough for any honest man that goes a
2369  passenger.’ Ha! Jonah, that’s another stab. But he swiftly calls away
2370  the Captain from that scent. ‘I’ll sail with ye,’—he says,—‘the passage
2371  money how much is that?—I’ll pay now.’ For it is particularly written,
2372  shipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history,
2373  ‘that he paid the fare thereof’ ere the craft did sail. And taken with
2374  the context, this is full of meaning.
2375  
2376  “Now Jonah’s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects
2377  crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In
2378  this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and
2379  without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all
2380  frontiers. So Jonah’s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah’s
2381  purse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum;
2382  and it’s assented to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive;
2383  but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with
2384  gold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions
2385  still molest the Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit.
2386  Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his
2387  passage. ‘Point out my state-room, Sir,’ says Jonah now, ‘I’m
2388  travel-weary; I need sleep.’ ‘Thou lookest like it,’ says the Captain,
2389  ‘there’s thy room.’ Jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the lock
2390  contains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain
2391  laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about the doors of
2392  convicts’ cells being never allowed to be locked within. All dressed
2393  and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds the
2394  little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is
2395  close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too,
2396  beneath the ship’s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment
2397  of that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of
2398  his bowels’ wards.
2399  
2400  “Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly
2401  oscillates in Jonah’s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the
2402  wharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and
2403  all, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity
2404  with reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight
2405  itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it
2406  hung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his
2407  tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful
2408  fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance. But that
2409  contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor, the
2410  ceiling, and the side, are all awry. ‘Oh! so my conscience hangs in
2411  me!’ he groans, ‘straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my
2412  soul are all in crookedness!’
2413  
2414  “Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still
2415  reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the
2416  Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him;
2417  as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy
2418  anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at
2419  last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as
2420  over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and
2421  there’s naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth,
2422  Jonah’s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.
2423  
2424  “And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and
2425  from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening,
2426  glides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded
2427  smugglers! the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not
2428  bear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to
2429  break. But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when
2430  boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the wind is
2431  shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with
2432  trampling feet right over Jonah’s head; in all this raging tumult,
2433  Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky and raging sea,
2434  feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far
2435  rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving
2436  the seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides
2437  of the ship—a berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast
2438  asleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead
2439  ear, ‘What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!’ Startled from his lethargy
2440  by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the
2441  deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at that moment he
2442  is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave
2443  after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs
2444  roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet
2445  afloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the
2446  steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing
2447  bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the
2448  tormented deep.
2449  
2450  “Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his
2451  cringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The
2452  sailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him,
2453  and at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to
2454  high Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this
2455  great tempest was upon them. The lot is Jonah’s; that discovered, then
2456  how furiously they mob him with their questions. ‘What is thine
2457  occupation? Whence comest thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now,
2458  my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask
2459  him who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer
2460  to those questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put
2461  by them, but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard
2462  hand of God that is upon him.
2463  
2464  “‘I am a Hebrew,’ he cries—and then—‘I fear the Lord the God of Heaven
2465  who hath made the sea and the dry land!’ Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well
2466  mightest thou fear the Lord God _then!_ Straightway, he now goes on to
2467  make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more
2468  appalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet supplicating
2469  God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his
2470  deserts,—when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him
2471  forth into the sea, for he knew that for _his_ sake this great tempest
2472  was upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means
2473  to save the ship. But all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder;
2474  then, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not
2475  unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.
2476  
2477  “And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea;
2478  when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea
2479  is still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water
2480  behind. He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless
2481  commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into
2482  the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory
2483  teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed
2484  unto the Lord out of the fish’s belly. But observe his prayer, and
2485  learn a weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and
2486  wail for direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is
2487  just. He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with
2488  this, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards
2489  His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance;
2490  not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment. And how pleasing
2491  to God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventual deliverance
2492  of him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah
2493  before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a
2494  model for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it
2495  like Jonah.”
2496  
2497  While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,
2498  slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,
2499  when describing Jonah’s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.
2500  His deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed
2501  the warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from
2502  off his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his
2503  simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.
2504  
2505  There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the
2506  leaves of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with
2507  closed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.
2508  
2509  But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly,
2510  with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these
2511  words:
2512  
2513  “Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press
2514  upon me. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that
2515  Jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to
2516  me, for I am a greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come
2517  down from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit,
2518  and listen as you listen, while some one of you reads _me_ that other
2519  and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to _me_, as a pilot of the
2520  living God. How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true
2521  things, and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the
2522  ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should
2523  raise, fled from his mission, and sought to escape his duty and his God
2524  by taking ship at Joppa. But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never
2525  reached. As we have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed
2526  him down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him
2527  along ‘into the midst of the seas,’ where the eddying depths sucked him
2528  ten thousand fathoms down, and ‘the weeds were wrapped about his head,’
2529  and all the watery world of woe bowled over him. Yet even then beyond
2530  the reach of any plummet—‘out of the belly of hell’—when the whale
2531  grounded upon the ocean’s utmost bones, even then, God heard the
2532  engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then God spake unto the
2533  fish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale
2534  came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the
2535  delights of air and earth; and ‘vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;’
2536  when the word of the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and
2537  beaten—his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring
2538  of the ocean—Jonah did the Almighty’s bidding. And what was that,
2539  shipmates? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! That was it!
2540  
2541  “This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of
2542  the living God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from
2543  Gospel duty! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God
2544  has brewed them into a gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than
2545  to appal! Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness! Woe
2546  to him who, in this world, courts not dishonor! Woe to him who would
2547  not be true, even though to be false were salvation! Yea, woe to him
2548  who, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching to others is
2549  himself a castaway!”
2550  
2551  He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his
2552  face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with
2553  a heavenly enthusiasm,—“But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of
2554  every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that delight,
2555  than the bottom of the woe is deep. Is not the main-truck higher than
2556  the kelson is low? Delight is to him—a far, far upward, and inward
2557  delight—who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever
2558  stands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong
2559  arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has
2560  gone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the
2561  truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out
2562  from under the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,—top-gallant
2563  delight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his
2564  God, and is only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the
2565  waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake
2566  from this sure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and deliciousness
2567  will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final
2568  breath—O Father!—chiefly known to me by Thy rod—mortal or immortal,
2569  here I die. I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world’s,
2570  or mine own. Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what is
2571  man that he should live out the lifetime of his God?”
2572  
2573  He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with
2574  his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed,
2575  and he was left alone in the place.
2576  
2577  
2578  CHAPTER 10. A Bosom Friend.
2579  
2580  Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there
2581  quite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some
2582  time. He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the
2583  stove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face that
2584  little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a
2585  jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to
2586  himself in his heathenish way.
2587  
2588  But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going
2589  to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap
2590  began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth
2591  page—as I fancied—stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and
2592  giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. He
2593  would then begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number
2594  one each time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and it was
2595  only by such a large number of fifties being found together, that his
2596  astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited.
2597  
2598  With much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and
2599  hideously marred about the face—at least to my taste—his countenance
2600  yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You
2601  cannot hide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I
2602  saw the traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes,
2603  fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a
2604  thousand devils. And besides all this, there was a certain lofty
2605  bearing about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not
2606  altogether maim. He looked like a man who had never cringed and never
2607  had had a creditor. Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved,
2608  his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked
2609  more expansive than it otherwise would, this I will not venture to
2610  decide; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent
2611  one. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washington’s
2612  head, as seen in the popular busts of him. It had the same long
2613  regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows, which were
2614  likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on
2615  top. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.
2616  
2617  Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be
2618  looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my
2619  presence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but
2620  appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous
2621  book. Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night
2622  previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found
2623  thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference
2624  of his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do
2625  not know exactly how to take them. At first they are overawing; their
2626  calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had
2627  noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little,
2628  with the other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever;
2629  appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances.
2630  All this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there
2631  was something almost sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand
2632  miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is—which was the only
2633  way he could get there—thrown among people as strange to him as though
2634  he were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease;
2635  preserving the utmost serenity; content with his own companionship;
2636  always equal to himself. Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy;
2637  though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that. But,
2638  perhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of
2639  so living or so striving. So soon as I hear that such or such a man
2640  gives himself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the
2641  dyspeptic old woman, he must have “broken his digester.”
2642  
2643  As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that
2644  mild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then
2645  only glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering
2646  round the casements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the
2647  storm booming without in solemn swells; I began to be sensible of
2648  strange feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart
2649  and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world. This soothing
2650  savage had redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference speaking a
2651  nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland
2652  deceits. Wild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to
2653  feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that
2654  would have repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus
2655  drew me. I’ll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness
2656  has proved but hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some
2657  friendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At
2658  first he little noticed these advances; but presently, upon my
2659  referring to his last night’s hospitalities, he made out to ask me
2660  whether we were again to be bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I
2661  thought he looked pleased, perhaps a little complimented.
2662  
2663  We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to
2664  him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures
2665  that were in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we
2666  went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to
2667  be seen in this famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and,
2668  producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And
2669  then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it
2670  regularly passing between us.
2671  
2672  If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan’s
2673  breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and
2674  left us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and
2675  unbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his
2676  forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that
2677  henceforth we were married; meaning, in his country’s phrase, that we
2678  were bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be. In a
2679  countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too
2680  premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple savage
2681  those old rules would not apply.
2682  
2683  After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room
2684  together. He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his
2685  enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some
2686  thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and
2687  mechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them
2688  towards me, and said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he
2689  silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers’ pockets. I let them stay.
2690  He then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed
2691  the paper fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed
2692  anxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I
2693  deliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or
2694  otherwise.
2695  
2696  I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible
2697  Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in
2698  worshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you
2699  suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and
2700  earth—pagans and all included—can possibly be jealous of an
2701  insignificant bit of black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?—to do
2702  the will of God—_that_ is worship. And what is the will of God?—to do
2703  to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me—_that_ is
2704  the will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish
2705  that this Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me in my particular
2706  Presbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I must then unite with him
2707  in his; ergo, I must turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped
2708  prop up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with
2709  Queequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that
2710  done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences
2711  and all the world. But we did not go to sleep without some little chat.
2712  
2713  How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential
2714  disclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the
2715  very bottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often
2716  lie and chat over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our
2717  hearts’ honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg—a cosy, loving pair.
2718  
2719  
2720  CHAPTER 11. Nightgown.
2721  
2722  We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and
2723  Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs
2724  over mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free
2725  and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what
2726  little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like
2727  getting up again, though day-break was yet some way down the future.
2728  
2729  Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position
2730  began to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves
2731  sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the
2732  head-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two
2733  noses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans. We felt
2734  very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors;
2735  indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the
2736  room. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some
2737  small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world
2738  that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If
2739  you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been
2740  so a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. But
2741  if, like Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown
2742  of your head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general
2743  consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm. For
2744  this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire,
2745  which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height
2746  of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket
2747  between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there
2748  you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.
2749  
2750  We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at
2751  once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether
2752  by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always
2753  keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of
2754  being in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright
2755  except his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper
2756  element of our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey
2757  part. Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and
2758  self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the
2759  unilluminated twelve-o’clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable
2760  revulsion. Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that
2761  perhaps it were best to strike a light, seeing that we were so wide
2762  awake; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs
2763  from his Tomahawk. Be it said, that though I had felt such a strong
2764  repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before, yet see how
2765  elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them.
2766  For now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me,
2767  even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy
2768  then. I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord’s policy of
2769  insurance. I was only alive to the condensed confidential
2770  comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend.
2771  With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the
2772  Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue
2773  hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.
2774  
2775  Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to
2776  far distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island;
2777  and, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He
2778  gladly complied. Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of
2779  his words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar
2780  with his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story
2781  such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.
2782  
2783  
2784  CHAPTER 12. Biographical.
2785  
2786  Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and
2787  South. It is not down in any map; true places never are.
2788  
2789  When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a
2790  grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green
2791  sapling; even then, in Queequeg’s ambitious soul, lurked a strong
2792  desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or
2793  two. His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and
2794  on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of
2795  unconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins—royal
2796  stuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he
2797  nourished in his untutored youth.
2798  
2799  A Sag Harbor ship visited his father’s bay, and Queequeg sought a
2800  passage to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of
2801  seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father’s influence
2802  could prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled
2803  off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when
2804  she quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a
2805  low tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into
2806  the water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with
2807  its prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and
2808  when the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her
2809  side; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe;
2810  climbed up the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the
2811  deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though
2812  hacked in pieces.
2813  
2814  In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a
2815  cutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and
2816  Queequeg budged not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his
2817  wild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and
2818  told him he might make himself at home. But this fine young savage—this
2819  sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain’s cabin. They put him down
2820  among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter
2821  content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained
2822  no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of
2823  enlightening his untutored countrymen. For at bottom—so he told me—he
2824  was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians, the
2825  arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were; and more
2826  than that, still better than they were. But, alas! the practices of
2827  whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both
2828  miserable and wicked; infinitely more so, than all his father’s
2829  heathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the
2830  sailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they
2831  spent their wages in _that_ place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for
2832  lost. Thought he, it’s a wicked world in all meridians; I’ll die a
2833  pagan.
2834  
2835  And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians,
2836  wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer
2837  ways about him, though now some time from home.
2838  
2839  By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having
2840  a coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he
2841  being very old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not
2842  yet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians,
2843  had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty
2844  pagan Kings before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,—as
2845  soon as he felt himself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he
2846  proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. They
2847  had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a
2848  sceptre now.
2849  
2850  I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future
2851  movements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon
2852  this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my
2853  intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port
2854  for an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to
2855  accompany me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the
2856  same watch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my
2857  every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of
2858  both worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection
2859  I now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such,
2860  could not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was
2861  wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted
2862  with the sea, as known to merchant seamen.
2863  
2864  His story being ended with his pipe’s last dying puff, Queequeg
2865  embraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the
2866  light, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon
2867  were sleeping.
2868  
2869  
2870  CHAPTER 13. Wheelbarrow.
2871  
2872  Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber,
2873  for a block, I settled my own and comrade’s bill; using, however, my
2874  comrade’s money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed
2875  amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between
2876  me and Queequeg—especially as Peter Coffin’s cock and bull stories
2877  about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person
2878  whom I now companied with.
2879  
2880  We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own
2881  poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg’s canvas sack and hammock, away we went
2882  down to “the Moss,” the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the
2883  wharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so
2884  much—for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their
2885  streets,—but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we
2886  heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg
2887  now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I
2888  asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and
2889  whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in
2890  substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet
2891  he had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of
2892  assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate
2893  with the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers and
2894  mowers, who go into the farmers’ meadows armed with their own
2895  scythes—though in no wise obliged to furnish them—even so, Queequeg,
2896  for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.
2897  
2898  Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about
2899  the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The
2900  owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his
2901  heavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the
2902  thing—though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in
2903  which to manage the barrow—Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it
2904  fast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. “Why,”
2905  said I, “Queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would
2906  think. Didn’t the people laugh?”
2907  
2908  Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of
2909  Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water
2910  of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and
2911  this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided
2912  mat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once
2913  touched at Rokovoko, and its commander—from all accounts, a very
2914  stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain—this
2915  commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg’s sister, a
2916  pretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding
2917  guests were assembled at the bride’s bamboo cottage, this Captain
2918  marches in, and being assigned the post of honor, placed himself over
2919  against the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the
2920  King, Queequeg’s father. Grace being said,—for those people have their
2921  grace as well as we—though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such
2922  times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying
2923  the ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts—Grace, I
2924  say, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial
2925  ceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and
2926  consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage
2927  circulates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting the
2928  ceremony, and thinking himself—being Captain of a ship—as having plain
2929  precedence over a mere island King, especially in the King’s own
2930  house—the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the
2931  punchbowl;—taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. “Now,” said
2932  Queequeg, “what you tink now?—Didn’t our people laugh?”
2933  
2934  At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the
2935  schooner. Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one
2936  side, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees
2937  all glittering in the clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of
2938  casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the
2939  world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while
2940  from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises
2941  of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises
2942  were on the start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only
2943  begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on,
2944  for ever and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness
2945  of all earthly effort.
2946  
2947  Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little
2948  Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his
2949  snortings. How I snuffed that Tartar air!—how I spurned that turnpike
2950  earth!—that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish
2951  heels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea
2952  which will permit no records.
2953  
2954  At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.
2955  His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed
2956  teeth. On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to
2957  the blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan.
2958  Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a
2959  wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes.
2960  So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging
2961  bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of
2962  the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow
2963  beings should be so companionable; as though a white man were anything
2964  more dignified than a whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies
2965  and bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, must have come
2966  from the heart and centre of all verdure. Queequeg caught one of these
2967  young saplings mimicking him behind his back. I thought the bumpkin’s
2968  hour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the brawny savage caught
2969  him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength,
2970  sent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly tapping his stern
2971  in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet,
2972  while Queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe
2973  and passed it to me for a puff.
2974  
2975  “Capting! Capting!” yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;
2976  “Capting, Capting, here’s the devil.”
2977  
2978  “Hallo, _you_ sir,” cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking
2979  up to Queequeg, “what in thunder do you mean by that? Don’t you know
2980  you might have killed that chap?”
2981  
2982  “What him say?” said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.
2983  
2984  “He say,” said I, “that you came near kill-e that man there,” pointing
2985  to the still shivering greenhorn.
2986  
2987  “Kill-e,” cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly
2988  expression of disdain, “ah! him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e
2989  so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!”
2990  
2991  “Look you,” roared the Captain, “I’ll kill-e _you_, you cannibal, if
2992  you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.”
2993  
2994  But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to
2995  mind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted
2996  the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to
2997  side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor
2998  fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all
2999  hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it,
3000  seemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in
3001  one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of
3002  snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable
3003  of being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing
3004  the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the
3005  midst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and
3006  crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured
3007  one end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso,
3008  caught it round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next
3009  jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was
3010  run into the wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern
3011  boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long
3012  living arc of a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming
3013  like a dog, throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by
3014  turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I
3015  looked at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.
3016  The greenhorn had gone down. Shooting himself perpendicularly from the
3017  water, Queequeg, now took an instant’s glance around him, and seeming
3018  to see just how matters were, dived down and disappeared. A few minutes
3019  more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the other
3020  dragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked them up. The poor
3021  bumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump; the
3022  captain begged his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a
3023  barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.
3024  
3025  Was there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he
3026  at all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He
3027  only asked for water—fresh water—something to wipe the brine off; that
3028  done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the
3029  bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying to
3030  himself—“It’s a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We
3031  cannibals must help these Christians.”
3032  
3033  
3034  CHAPTER 14. Nantucket.
3035  
3036  Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a
3037  fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.
3038  
3039  Nantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of
3040  the world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely
3041  than the Eddystone lighthouse. Look at it—a mere hillock, and elbow of
3042  sand; all beach, without a background. There is more sand there than
3043  you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some
3044  gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they
3045  don’t grow naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they have
3046  to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that
3047  pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true
3048  cross in Rome; that people there plant toadstools before their houses,
3049  to get under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an
3050  oasis, three blades in a day’s walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand
3051  shoes, something like Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up,
3052  belted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island
3053  of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams will
3054  sometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles. But these
3055  extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.
3056  
3057  Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was
3058  settled by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle
3059  swooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant
3060  Indian in his talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child
3061  borne out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the
3062  same direction. Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage
3063  they discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory
3064  casket,—the poor little Indian’s skeleton.
3065  
3066  What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should
3067  take to the sea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs
3068  in the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more
3069  experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,
3070  launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world;
3071  put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at
3072  Behring’s Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared
3073  everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the
3074  flood; most monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea
3075  Mastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that
3076  his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and
3077  malicious assaults!
3078  
3079  And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from
3080  their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like
3081  so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific,
3082  and Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America
3083  add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English
3084  overswarm all India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun;
3085  two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer’s. For the sea
3086  is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a
3087  right of way through it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges;
3088  armed ones but floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though
3089  following the sea as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships,
3090  other fragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw
3091  their living from the bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he alone
3092  resides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to
3093  it in ships; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation.
3094  _There_ is his home; _there_ lies his business, which a Noah’s flood
3095  would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China.
3096  He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among
3097  the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years
3098  he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells
3099  like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman.
3100  With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to
3101  sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight
3102  of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his
3103  very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.
3104  
3105  
3106  CHAPTER 15. Chowder.
3107  
3108  It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to
3109  anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no
3110  business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord
3111  of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the
3112  Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept
3113  hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin
3114  Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he
3115  plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck
3116  at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a
3117  yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to
3118  the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a
3119  corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first
3120  man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very
3121  much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg
3122  insisted that the yellow warehouse—our first point of departure—must be
3123  left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say
3124  it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in
3125  the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to
3126  inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no
3127  mistaking.
3128  
3129  Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses’ ears,
3130  swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an
3131  old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other
3132  side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows.
3133  Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I
3134  could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort
3135  of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes,
3136  _two_ of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It’s ominous, thinks
3137  I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port;
3138  tombstones staring at me in the whalemen’s chapel; and here a gallows!
3139  and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out
3140  oblique hints touching Tophet?
3141  
3142  I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman
3143  with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,
3144  under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured
3145  eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen
3146  shirt.
3147  
3148  “Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I’ll be combing ye!”
3149  
3150  “Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There’s Mrs. Hussey.”
3151  
3152  And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving
3153  Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon
3154  making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey,
3155  postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little
3156  room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently
3157  concluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”
3158  
3159  “What’s that about Cods, ma’am?” said I, with much politeness.
3160  
3161  “Clam or Cod?” she repeated.
3162  
3163  “A clam for supper? a cold clam; is _that_ what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?”
3164  says I, “but that’s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter
3165  time, ain’t it, Mrs. Hussey?”
3166  
3167  But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple
3168  Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing
3169  but the word “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading
3170  to the kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,” disappeared.
3171  
3172  “Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us
3173  both on one clam?”
3174  
3175  However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the
3176  apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder
3177  came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!
3178  hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than
3179  hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up
3180  into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully
3181  seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the
3182  frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing
3183  food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we
3184  despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and
3185  bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey’s clam and cod announcement, I thought I
3186  would try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered
3187  the word “cod” with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few
3188  moments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different
3189  flavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.
3190  
3191  We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I
3192  to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What’s
3193  that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? “But look,
3194  Queequeg, ain’t that a live eel in your bowl? Where’s your harpoon?”
3195  
3196  Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its
3197  name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for
3198  breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you
3199  began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area
3200  before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a
3201  polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account
3202  books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the
3203  milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning
3204  happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen’s
3205  boats, I saw Hosea’s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and
3206  marching along the sand with each foot in a cod’s decapitated head,
3207  looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.
3208  
3209  Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey
3210  concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to
3211  precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded
3212  his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. “Why not?” said I;
3213  “every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not?” “Because
3214  it’s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stiggs coming from that
3215  unfort’nt v’y’ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with
3216  only three barrels of _ile_, was found dead in my first floor back,
3217  with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to
3218  take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg”
3219  (for she had learned his name), “I will just take this here iron, and
3220  keep it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow
3221  for breakfast, men?”
3222  
3223  “Both,” says I; “and let’s have a couple of smoked herring by way of
3224  variety.”
3225  
3226  
3227  CHAPTER 16. The Ship.
3228  
3229  In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no
3230  small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been
3231  diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo
3232  had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it
3233  everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in
3234  harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say,
3235  Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest
3236  wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order
3237  to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself,
3238  I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though
3239  it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship
3240  myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.
3241  
3242  I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great
3243  confidence in the excellence of Yojo’s judgment and surprising forecast
3244  of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather
3245  good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in
3246  all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.
3247  
3248  Now, this plan of Queequeg’s, or rather Yojo’s, touching the selection
3249  of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little
3250  relied upon Queequeg’s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to
3251  carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances
3252  produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and
3253  accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined
3254  rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that
3255  trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up
3256  with Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of
3257  Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with
3258  Queequeg and Yojo that day; _how_ it was I never could find out, for,
3259  though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his
3260  liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his
3261  tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of
3262  shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged
3263  sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three
3264  ships up for three-years’ voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the
3265  Pequod. _Devil-Dam_, I do not know the origin of; _Tit-bit_ is obvious;
3266  _Pequod_, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated
3267  tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I
3268  peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the
3269  Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for
3270  a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.
3271  
3272  You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I
3273  know;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box
3274  galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a
3275  rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old
3276  school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed
3277  look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and
3278  calms of all four oceans, her old hull’s complexion was darkened like a
3279  French grenadier’s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her
3280  venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of
3281  Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts
3282  stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her
3283  ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped
3284  flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these
3285  her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining
3286  to the wild business that for more than half a century she had
3287  followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he
3288  commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one
3289  of the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term
3290  of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and
3291  inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,
3292  unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake’s carved buckler or
3293  bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his
3294  neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of
3295  trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased
3296  bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were
3297  garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the
3298  sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews
3299  and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood,
3300  but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile
3301  wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller
3302  was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her
3303  hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest,
3304  felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching
3305  its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things
3306  are touched with that.
3307  
3308  Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having
3309  authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at
3310  first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of
3311  tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It
3312  seemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical
3313  shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber
3314  black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the
3315  right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of
3316  these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at
3317  the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved
3318  to and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem’s head. A
3319  triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the
3320  insider commanded a complete view forward.
3321  
3322  And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by
3323  his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the
3324  ship’s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of
3325  command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all
3326  over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a
3327  stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was
3328  constructed.
3329  
3330  There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of
3331  the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,
3332  and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style;
3333  only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest
3334  wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his
3335  continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to
3336  windward;—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed
3337  together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.
3338  
3339  “Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of
3340  the tent.
3341  
3342  “Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of
3343  him?” he demanded.
3344  
3345  “I was thinking of shipping.”
3346  
3347  “Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a
3348  stove boat?”
3349  
3350  “No, Sir, I never have.”
3351  
3352  “Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?
3353  
3354  “Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I’ve been
3355  several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”
3356  
3357  “Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that
3358  leg?—I’ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of
3359  the marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose
3360  now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant
3361  ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?—it
3362  looks a little suspicious, don’t it, eh?—Hast not been a pirate, hast
3363  thou?—Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?—Dost not think of
3364  murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?”
3365  
3366  I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of
3367  these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated
3368  Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather
3369  distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the
3370  Vineyard.
3371  
3372  “But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of
3373  shipping ye.”
3374  
3375  “Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”
3376  
3377  “Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?”
3378  
3379  “Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”
3380  
3381  “Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”
3382  
3383  “I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.”
3384  
3385  “Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that’s who ye are speaking to,
3386  young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted
3387  out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We
3388  are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest
3389  to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way
3390  of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap
3391  eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one
3392  leg.”
3393  
3394  “What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”
3395  
3396  “Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed
3397  up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a
3398  boat!—ah, ah!”
3399  
3400  I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at
3401  the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I
3402  could, “What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know
3403  there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed
3404  I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.”
3405  
3406  “Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d’ye see; thou
3407  dost not talk shark a bit. _Sure_, ye’ve been to sea before now; sure
3408  of that?”
3409  
3410  “Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in
3411  the merchant—”
3412  
3413  “Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant
3414  service—don’t aggravate me—I won’t have it. But let us understand each
3415  other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel
3416  inclined for it?”
3417  
3418  “I do, sir.”
3419  
3420  “Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live
3421  whale’s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!”
3422  
3423  “I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to
3424  be got rid of, that is; which I don’t take to be the fact.”
3425  
3426  “Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find
3427  out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to
3428  see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just
3429  step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back
3430  to me and tell me what ye see there.”
3431  
3432  For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not
3433  knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But
3434  concentrating all his crow’s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started
3435  me on the errand.
3436  
3437  Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the
3438  ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely
3439  pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but
3440  exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I
3441  could see.
3442  
3443  “Well, what’s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye
3444  see?”
3445  
3446  “Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though,
3447  and there’s a squall coming up, I think.”
3448  
3449  “Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go
3450  round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can’t ye see the world where
3451  you stand?”
3452  
3453  I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the
3454  Pequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now
3455  repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his
3456  willingness to ship me.
3457  
3458  “And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come
3459  along with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the
3460  cabin.
3461  
3462  Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and
3463  surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with
3464  Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other
3465  shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd
3466  of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards;
3467  each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a
3468  nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in
3469  whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state
3470  stocks bringing in good interest.
3471  
3472  Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a
3473  Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to
3474  this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the
3475  peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by
3476  things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same
3477  Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They
3478  are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.
3479  
3480  So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with
3481  Scripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in
3482  childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the
3483  Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless
3484  adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these
3485  unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not
3486  unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when
3487  these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a
3488  globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and
3489  seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and
3490  beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think
3491  untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature’s sweet or
3492  savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding
3493  breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental
3494  advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes
3495  one in a whole nation’s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for
3496  noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically
3497  regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems
3498  a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For
3499  all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be
3500  sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease.
3501  But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another;
3502  and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from
3503  another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.
3504  
3505  Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman.
3506  But unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called
3507  serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the
3508  veriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally
3509  educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but
3510  all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely
3511  island creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native
3512  born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his
3513  vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common
3514  consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from
3515  conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself
3516  had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn
3517  foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled
3518  tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening
3519  of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the
3520  reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much,
3521  and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible
3522  conclusion that a man’s religion is one thing, and this practical world
3523  quite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little
3524  cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a
3525  broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header,
3526  chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted
3527  before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from
3528  active life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining
3529  days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.
3530  
3531  Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an
3532  incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard
3533  task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a
3534  curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew,
3535  upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital,
3536  sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker,
3537  he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used
3538  to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an
3539  inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When
3540  Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking
3541  at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch
3542  something—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at
3543  something or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished
3544  before him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian
3545  character. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no
3546  superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like
3547  the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.
3548  
3549  Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I
3550  followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks
3551  was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so,
3552  and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was
3553  placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was
3554  buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in
3555  reading from a ponderous volume.
3556  
3557  “Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been
3558  studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my
3559  certain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”
3560  
3561  As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,
3562  Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,
3563  and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.
3564  
3565  “He says he’s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”
3566  
3567  “Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.
3568  
3569  “I _dost_,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.
3570  
3571  “What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.
3572  
3573  “He’ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at
3574  his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.
3575  
3576  I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg,
3577  his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said
3578  nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest,
3579  and drawing forth the ship’s articles, placed pen and ink before him,
3580  and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time
3581  to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for
3582  the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid
3583  no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares
3584  of the profits called _lays_, and that these lays were proportioned to
3585  the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the
3586  ship’s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my
3587  own lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the
3588  sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt
3589  that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th
3590  lay—that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage,
3591  whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was
3592  what they call a rather _long lay_, yet it was better than nothing; and
3593  if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I
3594  would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years’ beef and board,
3595  for which I would not have to pay one stiver.
3596  
3597  It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely
3598  fortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those
3599  that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the
3600  world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this
3601  grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the
3602  275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been
3603  surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a
3604  broad-shouldered make.
3605  
3606  But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about
3607  receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard
3608  something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;
3609  how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore
3610  the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the
3611  whole management of the ship’s affairs to these two. And I did not know
3612  but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about
3613  shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod,
3614  quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his
3615  own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his
3616  jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he
3617  was such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded
3618  us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “_Lay_ not up for
3619  yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”
3620  
3621  “Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d’ye say, what lay
3622  shall we give this young man?”
3623  
3624  “Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and
3625  seventy-seventh wouldn’t be too much, would it?—‘where moth and rust do
3626  corrupt, but _lay_—’”
3627  
3628  _Lay_, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and
3629  seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,
3630  shall not _lay_ up many _lays_ here below, where moth and rust do
3631  corrupt. It was an exceedingly _long lay_ that, indeed; and though from
3632  the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet
3633  the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and
3634  seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a
3635  _teenth_ of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and
3636  seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven
3637  hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.
3638  
3639  “Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to
3640  swindle this young man! he must have more than that.”
3641  
3642  “Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting
3643  his eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there
3644  will your heart be also.”
3645  
3646  “I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do
3647  ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”
3648  
3649  Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,
3650  “Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the
3651  duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans,
3652  many of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this
3653  young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those
3654  orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”
3655  
3656  “Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the
3657  cabin. “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these
3658  matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be
3659  heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape
3660  Horn.”
3661  
3662  “Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing
3663  ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can’t tell; but as thou art
3664  still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy
3665  conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering
3666  down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”
3667  
3668  “Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye
3669  insult me. It’s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that
3670  he’s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me,
3671  and start my soul-bolts, but I’ll—I’ll—yes, I’ll swallow a live goat
3672  with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting,
3673  drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”
3674  
3675  As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a
3676  marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.
3677  
3678  Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and
3679  responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all
3680  idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily
3681  commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who,
3682  I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened
3683  wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the
3684  transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of
3685  withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As
3686  for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more
3687  left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a
3688  little as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the
3689  squall’s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at
3690  sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs
3691  the grindstone. That’s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man,
3692  Ishmael’s thy name, didn’t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael,
3693  for the three hundredth lay.”
3694  
3695  “Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship
3696  too—shall I bring him down to-morrow?”
3697  
3698  “To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we’ll look at him.”
3699  
3700  “What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in
3701  which he had again been burying himself.
3702  
3703  “Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever
3704  whaled it any?” turning to me.
3705  
3706  “Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”
3707  
3708  “Well, bring him along then.”
3709  
3710  And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I
3711  had done a good morning’s work, and that the Pequod was the identical
3712  ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.
3713  
3714  But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the
3715  Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,
3716  indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and
3717  receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by
3718  arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged,
3719  and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the
3720  captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he
3721  does not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to
3722  the owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to
3723  have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his
3724  hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain
3725  Ahab was to be found.
3726  
3727  “And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It’s all right enough; thou
3728  art shipped.”
3729  
3730  “Yes, but I should like to see him.”
3731  
3732  “But I don’t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don’t know
3733  exactly what’s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the
3734  house; a sort of sick, and yet he don’t look so. In fact, he ain’t
3735  sick; but no, he isn’t well either. Any how, young man, he won’t always
3736  see me, so I don’t suppose he will thee. He’s a queer man, Captain
3737  Ahab—so some think—but a good one. Oh, thou’lt like him well enough; no
3738  fear, no fear. He’s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab;
3739  doesn’t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen.
3740  Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab’s above the common; Ahab’s been in
3741  colleges, as well as ’mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders
3742  than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than
3743  whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our
3744  isle! Oh! he ain’t Captain Bildad; no, and he ain’t Captain Peleg;
3745  _he’s Ahab_, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!”
3746  
3747  “And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did
3748  they not lick his blood?”
3749  
3750  “Come hither to me—hither, hither,” said Peleg, with a significance in
3751  his eye that almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that on board
3752  the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself.
3753  ’Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died
3754  when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at
3755  Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And,
3756  perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn
3757  thee. It’s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I’ve sailed with him as
3758  mate years ago; I know what he is—a good man—not a pious, good man,
3759  like Bildad, but a swearing good man—something like me—only there’s a
3760  good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly;
3761  and I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind
3762  for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump
3763  that brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever
3764  since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he’s been a
3765  kind of moody—desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all
3766  pass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young
3767  man, it’s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad
3768  one. So good-bye to thee—and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens
3769  to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife—not three voyages
3770  wedded—a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that
3771  old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm
3772  in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his
3773  humanities!”
3774  
3775  As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been
3776  incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain
3777  wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the time,
3778  I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don’t know what,
3779  unless it was the cruel loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a strange
3780  awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was
3781  not exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I felt it; and it did
3782  not disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience at what seemed
3783  like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then.
3784  However, my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so
3785  that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.
3786  
3787  
3788  CHAPTER 17. The Ramadan.
3789  
3790  As Queequeg’s Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all
3791  day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for I
3792  cherish the greatest respect towards everybody’s religious obligations,
3793  never mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue
3794  even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other
3795  creatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of
3796  footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the
3797  torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the
3798  inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name.
3799  
3800  I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these
3801  things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,
3802  pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these
3803  subjects. There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most
3804  absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;—but what of that? Queequeg
3805  thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content;
3806  and there let him rest. All our arguing with him would not avail; let
3807  him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all—Presbyterians and Pagans
3808  alike—for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and
3809  sadly need mending.
3810  
3811  Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and
3812  rituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door;
3813  but no answer. I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.
3814  “Queequeg,” said I softly through the key-hole:—all silent. “I say,
3815  Queequeg! why don’t you speak? It’s I—Ishmael.” But all remained still
3816  as before. I began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant
3817  time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked through
3818  the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the
3819  key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one. I could only see
3820  part of the foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing
3821  more. I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden
3822  shaft of Queequeg’s harpoon, which the landlady the evening previous
3823  had taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber. That’s strange,
3824  thought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he
3825  seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be inside
3826  here, and no possible mistake.
3827  
3828  “Queequeg!—Queequeg!”—all still. Something must have happened.
3829  Apoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted.
3830  Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person
3831  I met—the chamber-maid. “La! la!” she cried, “I thought something must
3832  be the matter. I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was
3833  locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it’s been just so silent ever
3834  since. But I thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your
3835  baggage in for safe keeping. La! la, ma’am!—Mistress! murder! Mrs.
3836  Hussey! apoplexy!”—and with these cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I
3837  following.
3838  
3839  Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a
3840  vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation
3841  of attending to the castors, and scolding her little black boy
3842  meantime.
3843  
3844  “Wood-house!” cried I, “which way to it? Run for God’s sake, and fetch
3845  something to pry open the door—the axe!—the axe! he’s had a stroke;
3846  depend upon it!”—and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs
3847  again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot and
3848  vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.
3849  
3850  “What’s the matter with you, young man?”
3851  
3852  “Get the axe! For God’s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I pry
3853  it open!”
3854  
3855  “Look here,” said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet,
3856  so as to have one hand free; “look here; are you talking about prying
3857  open any of my doors?”—and with that she seized my arm. “What’s the
3858  matter with you? What’s the matter with you, shipmate?”
3859  
3860  In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand
3861  the whole case. Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of
3862  her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed—“No! I haven’t
3863  seen it since I put it there.” Running to a little closet under the
3864  landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that
3865  Queequeg’s harpoon was missing. “He’s killed himself,” she cried. “It’s
3866  unfort’nate Stiggs done over again—there goes another counterpane—God
3867  pity his poor mother!—it will be the ruin of my house. Has the poor lad
3868  a sister? Where’s that girl?—there, Betty, go to Snarles the Painter,
3869  and tell him to paint me a sign, with—“no suicides permitted here, and
3870  no smoking in the parlor;”—might as well kill both birds at once. Kill?
3871  The Lord be merciful to his ghost! What’s that noise there? You, young
3872  man, avast there!”
3873  
3874  And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force
3875  open the door.
3876  
3877  “I don’t allow it; I won’t have my premises spoiled. Go for the
3878  locksmith, there’s one about a mile from here. But avast!” putting her
3879  hand in her side-pocket, “here’s a key that’ll fit, I guess; let’s
3880  see.” And with that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas! Queequeg’s
3881  supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.
3882  
3883  “Have to burst it open,” said I, and was running down the entry a
3884  little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing
3885  I should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a
3886  sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.
3887  
3888  With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming
3889  against the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good
3890  heavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right
3891  in the middle of the room; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on
3892  top of his head. He looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat
3893  like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.
3894  
3895  “Queequeg,” said I, going up to him, “Queequeg, what’s the matter with
3896  you?”
3897  
3898  “He hain’t been a sittin’ so all day, has he?” said the landlady.
3899  
3900  But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt
3901  like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost
3902  intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained;
3903  especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of
3904  eight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.
3905  
3906  “Mrs. Hussey,” said I, “he’s _alive_ at all events; so leave us, if you
3907  please, and I will see to this strange affair myself.”
3908  
3909  Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon
3910  Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could
3911  do—for all my polite arts and blandishments—he would not move a peg,
3912  nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in
3913  the slightest way.
3914  
3915  I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do
3916  they fast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so;
3917  yes, it’s part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he’ll
3918  get up sooner or later, no doubt. It can’t last for ever, thank God,
3919  and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don’t believe it’s very
3920  punctual then.
3921  
3922  I went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long
3923  stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage,
3924  as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or
3925  brig, confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only);
3926  after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o’clock, I
3927  went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg
3928  must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there
3929  he was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began
3930  to grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to
3931  be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room,
3932  holding a piece of wood on his head.
3933  
3934  “For heaven’s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and
3935  have some supper. You’ll starve; you’ll kill yourself, Queequeg.” But
3936  not a word did he reply.
3937  
3938  Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;
3939  and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to
3940  turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as
3941  it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his
3942  ordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not
3943  get into the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere
3944  thought of Queequeg—not four feet off—sitting there in that uneasy
3945  position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really
3946  wretched. Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide
3947  awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!
3948  
3949  But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of
3950  day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he
3951  had been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of
3952  sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but
3953  with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his
3954  forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.
3955  
3956  Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person’s religion,
3957  be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any
3958  other person, because that other person don’t believe it also. But when
3959  a man’s religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment
3960  to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to
3961  lodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and
3962  argue the point with him.
3963  
3964  And just so I now did with Queequeg. “Queequeg,” said I, “get into bed
3965  now, and lie and listen to me.” I then went on, beginning with the rise
3966  and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various
3967  religions of the present time, during which time I labored to show
3968  Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings
3969  in cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health;
3970  useless for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene
3971  and common sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such
3972  an extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly
3973  pained me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous
3974  Ramadan of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in;
3975  hence the spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must
3976  necessarily be half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic
3977  religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In
3978  one word, Queequeg, said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first
3979  born on an undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated
3980  through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.
3981  
3982  I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with
3983  dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it
3984  in. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great
3985  feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle
3986  wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o’clock in the
3987  afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.
3988  
3989  “No more, Queequeg,” said I, shuddering; “that will do;” for I knew the
3990  inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who
3991  had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom,
3992  when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in
3993  the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were
3994  placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau,
3995  with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths,
3996  were sent round with the victor’s compliments to all his friends, just
3997  as though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.
3998  
3999  After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much
4000  impression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow
4001  seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered
4002  from his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more
4003  than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,
4004  finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true
4005  religion than I did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending
4006  concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such
4007  a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan
4008  piety.
4009  
4010  At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty
4011  breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not
4012  make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the
4013  Pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.
4014  
4015  
4016  CHAPTER 18. His Mark.
4017  
4018  As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg
4019  carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us
4020  from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal,
4021  and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that
4022  craft, unless they previously produced their papers.
4023  
4024  “What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?” said I, now jumping on the
4025  bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.
4026  
4027  “I mean,” he replied, “he must show his papers.”
4028  
4029  “Yes,” said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from
4030  behind Peleg’s, out of the wigwam. “He must show that he’s converted.
4031  Son of darkness,” he added, turning to Queequeg, “art thou at present
4032  in communion with any Christian church?”
4033  
4034  “Why,” said I, “he’s a member of the first Congregational Church.” Here
4035  be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at
4036  last come to be converted into the churches.
4037  
4038  “First Congregational Church,” cried Bildad, “what! that worships in
4039  Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman’s meeting-house?” and so saying, taking out
4040  his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana
4041  handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the
4042  wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at
4043  Queequeg.
4044  
4045  “How long hath he been a member?” he then said, turning to me; “not
4046  very long, I rather guess, young man.”
4047  
4048  “No,” said Peleg, “and he hasn’t been baptized right either, or it
4049  would have washed some of that devil’s blue off his face.”
4050  
4051  “Do tell, now,” cried Bildad, “is this Philistine a regular member of
4052  Deacon Deuteronomy’s meeting? I never saw him going there, and I pass
4053  it every Lord’s day.”
4054  
4055  “I don’t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,” said
4056  I; “all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First
4057  Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.”
4058  
4059  “Young man,” said Bildad sternly, “thou art skylarking with me—explain
4060  thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.”
4061  
4062  Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. “I mean, sir, the same
4063  ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there,
4064  and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother’s son and soul of us
4065  belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole
4066  worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some
4067  queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in _that_ we all
4068  join hands.”
4069  
4070  “Splice, thou mean’st _splice_ hands,” cried Peleg, drawing nearer.
4071  “Young man, you’d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast
4072  hand; I never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy—why Father
4073  Mapple himself couldn’t beat it, and he’s reckoned something. Come
4074  aboard, come aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell Quohog
4075  there—what’s that you call him? tell Quohog to step along. By the great
4076  anchor, what a harpoon he’s got there! looks like good stuff that; and
4077  he handles it about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did
4078  you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a
4079  fish?”
4080  
4081  Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon
4082  the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats
4083  hanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his
4084  harpoon, cried out in some such way as this:—
4085  
4086  “Cap’ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him? well,
4087  spose him one whale eye, well, den!” and taking sharp aim at it, he
4088  darted the iron right over old Bildad’s broad brim, clean across the
4089  ship’s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.
4090  
4091  “Now,” said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, “spos-ee him whale-e
4092  eye; why, dad whale dead.”
4093  
4094  “Quick, Bildad,” said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close
4095  vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin
4096  gangway. “Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship’s papers. We must
4097  have Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye,
4098  Quohog, we’ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that’s more than ever was
4099  given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.”
4100  
4101  So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon
4102  enrolled among the same ship’s company to which I myself belonged.
4103  
4104  When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for
4105  signing, he turned to me and said, “I guess, Quohog there don’t know
4106  how to write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name
4107  or make thy mark?”
4108  
4109  But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken
4110  part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the
4111  offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact
4112  counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm; so
4113  that through Captain Peleg’s obstinate mistake touching his
4114  appellative, it stood something like this:—
4115  
4116  Quohog. his X mark.
4117  
4118  Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg,
4119  and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his
4120  broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one
4121  entitled “The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,” placed it in
4122  Queequeg’s hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his,
4123  looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, “Son of darkness, I must do
4124  my duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for
4125  the souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways,
4126  which I sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial
4127  bondsman. Spurn the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the
4128  wrath to come; mind thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer
4129  clear of the fiery pit!”
4130  
4131  Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad’s language,
4132  heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.
4133  
4134  “Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer,”
4135  cried Peleg. “Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers—it takes the
4136  shark out of ’em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty
4137  sharkish. There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out
4138  of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never
4139  came to good. He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he
4140  shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case
4141  he got stove and went to Davy Jones.”
4142  
4143  “Peleg! Peleg!” said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, “thou thyself,
4144  as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what
4145  it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can’st thou prate in this
4146  ungodly guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this
4147  same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on
4148  Japan, that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did’st
4149  thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?”
4150  
4151  “Hear him, hear him now,” cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and
4152  thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,—“hear him, all of ye.
4153  Think of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death
4154  and the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an
4155  everlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over
4156  us, fore and aft. Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to
4157  think about Death then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking
4158  of; and how to save all hands—how to rig jury-masts—how to get into the
4159  nearest port; that was what I was thinking of.”
4160  
4161  Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where
4162  we followed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some
4163  sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then he
4164  stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which
4165  otherwise might have been wasted.
4166  
4167  
4168  CHAPTER 19. The Prophet.
4169  
4170  “Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?”
4171  
4172  Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from
4173  the water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when the
4174  above words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us,
4175  levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question. He was but
4176  shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a
4177  black handkerchief investing his neck. A confluent small-pox had in all
4178  directions flowed over his face, and left it like the complicated
4179  ribbed bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been dried up.
4180  
4181  “Have ye shipped in her?” he repeated.
4182  
4183  “You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,” said I, trying to gain a little
4184  more time for an uninterrupted look at him.
4185  
4186  “Aye, the Pequod—that ship there,” he said, drawing back his whole arm,
4187  and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the fixed
4188  bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.
4189  
4190  “Yes,” said I, “we have just signed the articles.”
4191  
4192  “Anything down there about your souls?”
4193  
4194  “About what?”
4195  
4196  “Oh, perhaps you hav’n’t got any,” he said quickly. “No matter though,
4197  I know many chaps that hav’n’t got any,—good luck to ’em; and they are
4198  all the better off for it. A soul’s a sort of a fifth wheel to a
4199  wagon.”
4200  
4201  “What are you jabbering about, shipmate?” said I.
4202  
4203  “_He’s_ got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that
4204  sort in other chaps,” abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous
4205  emphasis upon the word _he_.
4206  
4207  “Queequeg,” said I, “let’s go; this fellow has broken loose from
4208  somewhere; he’s talking about something and somebody we don’t know.”
4209  
4210  “Stop!” cried the stranger. “Ye said true—ye hav’n’t seen Old Thunder
4211  yet, have ye?”
4212  
4213  “Who’s Old Thunder?” said I, again riveted with the insane earnestness
4214  of his manner.
4215  
4216  “Captain Ahab.”
4217  
4218  “What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?”
4219  
4220  “Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye
4221  hav’n’t seen him yet, have ye?”
4222  
4223  “No, we hav’n’t. He’s sick they say, but is getting better, and will be
4224  all right again before long.”
4225  
4226  “All right again before long!” laughed the stranger, with a solemnly
4227  derisive sort of laugh. “Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right, then
4228  this left arm of mine will be all right; not before.”
4229  
4230  “What do you know about him?”
4231  
4232  “What did they _tell_ you about him? Say that!”
4233  
4234  “They didn’t tell much of anything about him; only I’ve heard that he’s
4235  a good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew.”
4236  
4237  “That’s true, that’s true—yes, both true enough. But you must jump when
4238  he gives an order. Step and growl; growl and go—that’s the word with
4239  Captain Ahab. But nothing about that thing that happened to him off
4240  Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days and nights;
4241  nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar
4242  in Santa?—heard nothing about that, eh? Nothing about the silver
4243  calabash he spat into? And nothing about his losing his leg last
4244  voyage, according to the prophecy. Didn’t ye hear a word about them
4245  matters and something more, eh? No, I don’t think ye did; how could ye?
4246  Who knows it? Not all Nantucket, I guess. But hows’ever, mayhap, ye’ve
4247  heard tell about the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of
4248  that, I dare say. Oh yes, _that_ every one knows a’most—I mean they
4249  know he’s only one leg; and that a parmacetti took the other off.”
4250  
4251  “My friend,” said I, “what all this gibberish of yours is about, I
4252  don’t know, and I don’t much care; for it seems to me that you must be
4253  a little damaged in the head. But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab,
4254  of that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all
4255  about the loss of his leg.”
4256  
4257  “_All_ about it, eh—sure you do?—all?”
4258  
4259  “Pretty sure.”
4260  
4261  With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like
4262  stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a
4263  little, turned and said:—“Ye’ve shipped, have ye? Names down on the
4264  papers? Well, well, what’s signed, is signed; and what’s to be, will
4265  be; and then again, perhaps it won’t be, after all. Anyhow, it’s all
4266  fixed and arranged a’ready; and some sailors or other must go with him,
4267  I suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity ’em! Morning to ye,
4268  shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; I’m sorry I stopped
4269  ye.”
4270  
4271  “Look here, friend,” said I, “if you have anything important to tell
4272  us, out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are
4273  mistaken in your game; that’s all I have to say.”
4274  
4275  “And it’s said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way;
4276  you are just the man for him—the likes of ye. Morning to ye, shipmates,
4277  morning! Oh! when ye get there, tell ’em I’ve concluded not to make one
4278  of ’em.”
4279  
4280  “Ah, my dear fellow, you can’t fool us that way—you can’t fool us. It
4281  is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a
4282  great secret in him.”
4283  
4284  “Morning to ye, shipmates, morning.”
4285  
4286  “Morning it is,” said I. “Come along, Queequeg, let’s leave this crazy
4287  man. But stop, tell me your name, will you?”
4288  
4289  “Elijah.”
4290  
4291  Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each
4292  other’s fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was
4293  nothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we had not gone
4294  perhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and
4295  looking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us,
4296  though at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I
4297  said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my
4298  comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner
4299  that we did. He did; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us,
4300  but with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine. This
4301  circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing,
4302  shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments
4303  and half-apprehensions, and all connected with the Pequod; and Captain
4304  Ahab; and the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver
4305  calabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship
4306  the day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig; and the
4307  voyage we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy
4308  things.
4309  
4310  I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really
4311  dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg,
4312  and on that side of it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on,
4313  without seeming to notice us. This relieved me; and once more, and
4314  finally as it seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.
4315  
4316  
4317  CHAPTER 20. All Astir.
4318  
4319  A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod.
4320  Not only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on
4321  board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything
4322  betokened that the ship’s preparations were hurrying to a close.
4323  Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam
4324  keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the purchasing
4325  and providing at the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on
4326  the rigging were working till long after night-fall.
4327  
4328  On the day following Queequeg’s signing the articles, word was given at
4329  all the inns where the ship’s company were stopping, that their chests
4330  must be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon the
4331  vessel might be sailing. So Queequeg and I got down our traps,
4332  resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last. But it seems they
4333  always give very long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail
4334  for several days. But no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and
4335  there is no telling how many things to be thought of, before the Pequod
4336  was fully equipped.
4337  
4338  Every one knows what a multitude of things—beds, sauce-pans, knives and
4339  forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are
4340  indispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling,
4341  which necessitates a three-years’ housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far
4342  from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And
4343  though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means
4344  to the same extent as with whalemen. For besides the great length of
4345  the whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution
4346  of the fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote
4347  harbors usually frequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships,
4348  whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and
4349  especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which
4350  the success of the voyage most depends. Hence, the spare boats, spare
4351  spars, and spare lines and harpoons, and spare everythings, almost, but
4352  a spare Captain and duplicate ship.
4353  
4354  At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the
4355  Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water,
4356  fuel, and iron hoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for some time
4357  there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and
4358  ends of things, both large and small.
4359  
4360  Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain
4361  Bildad’s sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable
4362  spirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if _she_
4363  could help it, nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after
4364  once fairly getting to sea. At one time she would come on board with a
4365  jar of pickles for the steward’s pantry; another time with a bunch of
4366  quills for the chief mate’s desk, where he kept his log; a third time
4367  with a roll of flannel for the small of some one’s rheumatic back.
4368  Never did any woman better deserve her name, which was Charity—Aunt
4369  Charity, as everybody called her. And like a sister of charity did this
4370  charitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn
4371  her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety, comfort,
4372  and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother
4373  Bildad was concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of
4374  well-saved dollars.
4375  
4376  But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on
4377  board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and
4378  a still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor
4379  Captain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him
4380  a long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down
4381  went his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once in a
4382  while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men
4383  down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and
4384  then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.
4385  
4386  During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the
4387  craft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and
4388  when he was going to come on board his ship. To these questions they
4389  would answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected
4390  aboard every day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could
4391  attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I
4392  had been downright honest with myself, I would have seen very plainly
4393  in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so
4394  long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the
4395  absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open
4396  sea. But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he
4397  be already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up
4398  his suspicions even from himself. And much this way it was with me. I
4399  said nothing, and tried to think nothing.
4400  
4401  At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would
4402  certainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early
4403  start.
4404  
4405  
4406  CHAPTER 21. Going Aboard.
4407  
4408  It was nearly six o’clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we
4409  drew nigh the wharf.
4410  
4411  “There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,” said I to
4412  Queequeg, “it can’t be shadows; she’s off by sunrise, I guess; come
4413  on!”
4414  
4415  “Avast!” cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close
4416  behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating
4417  himself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain
4418  twilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.
4419  
4420  “Going aboard?”
4421  
4422  “Hands off, will you,” said I.
4423  
4424  “Lookee here,” said Queequeg, shaking himself, “go ’way!”
4425  
4426  “Ain’t going aboard, then?”
4427  
4428  “Yes, we are,” said I, “but what business is that of yours? Do you
4429  know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?”
4430  
4431  “No, no, no; I wasn’t aware of that,” said Elijah, slowly and
4432  wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable
4433  glances.
4434  
4435  “Elijah,” said I, “you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We
4436  are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not to be
4437  detained.”
4438  
4439  “Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?”
4440  
4441  “He’s cracked, Queequeg,” said I, “come on.”
4442  
4443  “Holloa!” cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a few
4444  paces.
4445  
4446  “Never mind him,” said I, “Queequeg, come on.”
4447  
4448  But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my
4449  shoulder, said—“Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that
4450  ship a while ago?”
4451  
4452  Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, “Yes,
4453  I thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure.”
4454  
4455  “Very dim, very dim,” said Elijah. “Morning to ye.”
4456  
4457  Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and
4458  touching my shoulder again, said, “See if you can find ’em now, will
4459  ye?
4460  
4461  “Find who?”
4462  
4463  “Morning to ye! morning to ye!” he rejoined, again moving off. “Oh! I
4464  was going to warn ye against—but never mind, never mind—it’s all one,
4465  all in the family too;—sharp frost this morning, ain’t it? Good-bye to
4466  ye. Shan’t see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it’s before the
4467  Grand Jury.” And with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving
4468  me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.
4469  
4470  At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound
4471  quiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the
4472  hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward
4473  to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a
4474  light, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a
4475  tattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his
4476  face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber
4477  slept upon him.
4478  
4479  “Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?” said I,
4480  looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the
4481  wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I
4482  would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that
4483  matter, were it not for Elijah’s otherwise inexplicable question. But I
4484  beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to
4485  Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to
4486  establish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper’s rear,
4487  as though feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado,
4488  sat quietly down there.
4489  
4490  “Gracious! Queequeg, don’t sit there,” said I.
4491  
4492  “Oh! perry dood seat,” said Queequeg, “my country way; won’t hurt him
4493  face.”
4494  
4495  “Face!” said I, “call that his face? very benevolent countenance then;
4496  but how hard he breathes, he’s heaving himself; get off, Queequeg, you
4497  are heavy, it’s grinding the face of the poor. Get off, Queequeg! Look,
4498  he’ll twitch you off soon. I wonder he don’t wake.”
4499  
4500  Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and
4501  lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing
4502  over the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning
4503  him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his
4504  land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,
4505  chiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening
4506  some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house
4507  comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy
4508  fellows, and lay them round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was
4509  very convenient on an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs
4510  which are convertible into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief
4511  calling his attendant, and desiring him to make a settee of himself
4512  under a spreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy place.
4513  
4514  While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk
4515  from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper’s head.
4516  
4517  “What’s that for, Queequeg?”
4518  
4519  “Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!”
4520  
4521  He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,
4522  which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed
4523  his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The
4524  strong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole, it began to
4525  tell upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed
4526  troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and
4527  rubbed his eyes.
4528  
4529  “Holloa!” he breathed at last, “who be ye smokers?”
4530  
4531  “Shipped men,” answered I, “when does she sail?”
4532  
4533  “Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain
4534  came aboard last night.”
4535  
4536  “What Captain?—Ahab?”
4537  
4538  “Who but him indeed?”
4539  
4540  I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we
4541  heard a noise on deck.
4542  
4543  “Holloa! Starbuck’s astir,” said the rigger. “He’s a lively chief mate,
4544  that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.” And so
4545  saying he went on deck, and we followed.
4546  
4547  It was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and
4548  threes; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively
4549  engaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various
4550  last things on board. Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly
4551  enshrined within his cabin.
4552  
4553  
4554  CHAPTER 22. Merry Christmas.
4555  
4556  At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship’s
4557  riggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and
4558  after the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with
4559  her last gift—a night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her
4560  brother-in-law, and a spare Bible for the steward—after all this, the
4561  two Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to
4562  the chief mate, Peleg said:
4563  
4564  “Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is
4565  all ready—just spoke to him—nothing more to be got from shore, eh?
4566  Well, call all hands, then. Muster ’em aft here—blast ’em!”
4567  
4568  “No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg,” said
4569  Bildad, “but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.”
4570  
4571  How now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain
4572  Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the
4573  quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as
4574  well as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign
4575  of him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But
4576  then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in
4577  getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed,
4578  as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot’s; and as he
4579  was not yet completely recovered—so they said—therefore, Captain Ahab
4580  stayed below. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the
4581  merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a
4582  considerable time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the
4583  cabin table, having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends,
4584  before they quit the ship for good with the pilot.
4585  
4586  But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain
4587  Peleg was now all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and
4588  commanding, and not Bildad.
4589  
4590  “Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,” he cried, as the sailors lingered at
4591  the main-mast. “Mr. Starbuck, drive ’em aft.”
4592  
4593  “Strike the tent there!”—was the next order. As I hinted before, this
4594  whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the
4595  Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known
4596  to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.
4597  
4598  “Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!—jump!”—was the next command, and
4599  the crew sprang for the handspikes.
4600  
4601  Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot
4602  is the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be
4603  it known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed
4604  pilots of the port—he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot
4605  in order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was
4606  concerned in, for he never piloted any other craft—Bildad, I say, might
4607  now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the
4608  approaching anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave
4609  of psalmody, to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some
4610  sort of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good
4611  will. Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that
4612  no profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in
4613  getting under weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice
4614  copy of Watts in each seaman’s berth.
4615  
4616  Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped
4617  and swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he
4618  would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I
4619  paused on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of
4620  the perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for
4621  a pilot. I was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in
4622  pious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred
4623  and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear,
4624  and turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in
4625  the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my
4626  first kick.
4627  
4628  “Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?” he roared.
4629  “Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don’t ye
4630  spring, I say, all of ye—spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red
4631  whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I
4632  say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!” And so saying, he moved
4633  along the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while
4634  imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I,
4635  Captain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.
4636  
4637  At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It
4638  was a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into
4639  night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose
4640  freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of
4641  teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white
4642  ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from
4643  the bows.
4644  
4645  Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as
4646  the old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering
4647  frost all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his
4648  steady notes were heard,—
4649  
4650  
4651  _“Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood, Stand dressed in living
4652  green. So to the Jews old Canaan stood, While Jordan rolled between.”_
4653  
4654  
4655  
4656  Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then. They
4657  were full of hope and fruition. Spite of this frigid winter night in
4658  the boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there
4659  was yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store; and
4660  meads and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by the
4661  spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.
4662  
4663  At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no
4664  longer. The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging
4665  alongside.
4666  
4667  It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected
4668  at this juncture, especially Captain Bildad. For loath to depart, yet;
4669  very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a
4670  voyage—beyond both stormy Capes; a ship in which some thousands of his
4671  hard earned dollars were invested; a ship, in which an old shipmate
4672  sailed as captain; a man almost as old as he, once more starting to
4673  encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath to say good-bye to
4674  a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him,—poor old Bildad
4675  lingered long; paced the deck with anxious strides; ran down into the
4676  cabin to speak another farewell word there; again came on deck, and
4677  looked to windward; looked towards the wide and endless waters, only
4678  bounded by the far-off unseen Eastern Continents; looked towards the
4679  land; looked aloft; looked right and left; looked everywhere and
4680  nowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin,
4681  convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand, and holding up a lantern,
4682  for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as much as to say,
4683  “Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.”
4684  
4685  As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all
4686  his philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern
4687  came too near. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck—now
4688  a word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.
4689  
4690  But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look about
4691  him,—“Captain Bildad—come, old shipmate, we must go. Back the main-yard
4692  there! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside, now! Careful,
4693  careful!—come, Bildad, boy—say your last. Luck to ye, Starbuck—luck to
4694  ye, Mr. Stubb—luck to ye, Mr. Flask—good-bye and good luck to ye
4695  all—and this day three years I’ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in
4696  old Nantucket. Hurrah and away!”
4697  
4698  “God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men,” murmured old
4699  Bildad, almost incoherently. “I hope ye’ll have fine weather now, so
4700  that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye—a pleasant sun is all he
4701  needs, and ye’ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go. Be
4702  careful in the hunt, ye mates. Don’t stave the boats needlessly, ye
4703  harpooneers; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent.
4704  within the year. Don’t forget your prayers, either. Mr. Starbuck, mind
4705  that cooper don’t waste the spare staves. Oh! the sail-needles are in
4706  the green locker! Don’t whale it too much a’ Lord’s days, men; but
4707  don’t miss a fair chance either, that’s rejecting Heaven’s good gifts.
4708  Have an eye to the molasses tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a little leaky, I
4709  thought. If ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask, beware of fornication.
4710  Good-bye, good-bye! Don’t keep that cheese too long down in the hold,
4711  Mr. Starbuck; it’ll spoil. Be careful with the butter—twenty cents the
4712  pound it was, and mind ye, if—”
4713  
4714  “Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,—away!” and with that,
4715  Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.
4716  
4717  Ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a
4718  screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave
4719  three heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the lone
4720  Atlantic.
4721  
4722  
4723  CHAPTER 23. The Lee Shore.
4724  
4725  Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded
4726  mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.
4727  
4728  When on that shivering winter’s night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive
4729  bows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see standing at her
4730  helm but Bulkington! I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon
4731  the man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years’ dangerous
4732  voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still another
4733  tempestuous term. The land seemed scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest
4734  things are ever the unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs;
4735  this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkington. Let me only
4736  say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that
4737  miserably drives along the leeward land. The port would fain give
4738  succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort,
4739  hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that’s kind to our
4740  mortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that ship’s
4741  direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land,
4742  though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and
4743  through. With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing,
4744  fights ’gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks
4745  all the lashed sea’s landlessness again; for refuge’s sake forlornly
4746  rushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!
4747  
4748  Know ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally
4749  intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid
4750  effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the
4751  wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the
4752  treacherous, slavish shore?
4753  
4754  But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless,
4755  indefinite as God—so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite,
4756  than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For
4757  worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the
4758  terrible! is all this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O
4759  Bulkington! Bear thee grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy
4760  ocean-perishing—straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!
4761  
4762  
4763  CHAPTER 24. The Advocate.
4764  
4765  As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling;
4766  and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among
4767  landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I
4768  am all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby
4769  done to us hunters of whales.
4770  
4771  In the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish
4772  the fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not
4773  accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions. If a
4774  stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society,
4775  it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were
4776  he presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation
4777  of the naval officers he should append the initials S.W.F. (Sperm Whale
4778  Fishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed
4779  pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.
4780  
4781  Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us
4782  whalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a
4783  butchering sort of business; and that when actively engaged therein, we
4784  are surrounded by all manner of defilements. Butchers we are, that is
4785  true. But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been
4786  all Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor. And
4787  as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye
4788  shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally
4789  unknown, and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm
4790  whale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But
4791  even granting the charge in question to be true; what disordered
4792  slippery decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable
4793  carrion of those battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to
4794  drink in all ladies’ plaudits? And if the idea of peril so much
4795  enhances the popular conceit of the soldier’s profession; let me assure
4796  ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery, would
4797  quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale’s vast tail,
4798  fanning into eddies the air over his head. For what are the
4799  comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and
4800  wonders of God!
4801  
4802  But, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it
4803  unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding
4804  adoration! for almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn
4805  round the globe, burn, as before so many shrines, to our glory!
4806  
4807  But look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of
4808  scales; see what we whalemen are, and have been.
4809  
4810  Why did the Dutch in De Witt’s time have admirals of their whaling
4811  fleets? Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense, fit
4812  out whaling ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some
4813  score or two of families from our own island of Nantucket? Why did
4814  Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties
4815  upwards of £1,000,000? And lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of
4816  America now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world;
4817  sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned by eighteen
4818  thousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the ships worth,
4819  at the time of sailing, $20,000,000! and every year importing into our
4820  harbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000. How comes all this, if
4821  there be not something puissant in whaling?
4822  
4823  But this is not the half; look again.
4824  
4825  I freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life,
4826  point out one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty
4827  years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken
4828  in one aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling. One way
4829  and another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so
4830  continuously momentous in their sequential issues, that whaling may
4831  well be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore offspring themselves
4832  pregnant from her womb. It would be a hopeless, endless task to
4833  catalogue all these things. Let a handful suffice. For many years past
4834  the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and
4835  least known parts of the earth. She has explored seas and archipelagoes
4836  which had no chart, where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed. If
4837  American and European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage
4838  harbors, let them fire salutes to the honor and glory of the
4839  whale-ship, which originally showed them the way, and first interpreted
4840  between them and the savages. They may celebrate as they will the
4841  heroes of Exploring Expeditions, your Cooks, your Krusensterns; but I
4842  say that scores of anonymous Captains have sailed out of Nantucket,
4843  that were as great, and greater than your Cook and your Krusenstern.
4844  For in their succourless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish
4845  sharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands,
4846  battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines
4847  and muskets would not willingly have dared. All that is made such a
4848  flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, those things were but the
4849  life-time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers. Often, adventures
4850  which Vancouver dedicates three chapters to, these men accounted
4851  unworthy of being set down in the ship’s common log. Ah, the world! Oh,
4852  the world!
4853  
4854  Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial,
4855  scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe
4856  and the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific
4857  coast. It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy
4858  of the Spanish crown, touching those colonies; and, if space permitted,
4859  it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated
4860  the liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain,
4861  and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts.
4862  
4863  That great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was
4864  given to the enlightened world by the whaleman. After its first
4865  blunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned
4866  those shores as pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched
4867  there. The whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony.
4868  Moreover, in the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the
4869  emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent
4870  biscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters.
4871  The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do
4872  commercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the
4873  missionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive
4874  missionaries to their first destinations. If that double-bolted land,
4875  Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone to whom
4876  the credit will be due; for already she is on the threshold.
4877  
4878  But if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no
4879  æsthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I ready to
4880  shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet
4881  every time.
4882  
4883  The whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you
4884  will say.
4885  
4886  _The whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler?_ Who
4887  wrote the first account of our Leviathan? Who but mighty Job! And who
4888  composed the first narrative of a whaling-voyage? Who, but no less a
4889  prince than Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen, took down
4890  the words from Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those times! And
4891  who pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament? Who, but Edmund Burke!
4892  
4893  True enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have no
4894  good blood in their veins.
4895  
4896  _No good blood in their veins?_ They have something better than royal
4897  blood there. The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel;
4898  afterwards, by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of
4899  Nantucket, and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and
4900  harpooneers—all kith and kin to noble Benjamin—this day darting the
4901  barbed iron from one side of the world to the other.
4902  
4903  Good again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not
4904  respectable.
4905  
4906  _Whaling not respectable?_ Whaling is imperial! By old English
4907  statutory law, the whale is declared “a royal fish.” *
4908  
4909  Oh, that’s only nominal! The whale himself has never figured in any
4910  grand imposing way.
4911  
4912  _The whale never figured in any grand imposing way?_ In one of the
4913  mighty triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the world’s
4914  capital, the bones of a whale, brought all the way from the Syrian
4915  coast, were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession.*
4916  
4917  *See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.
4918  
4919  Grant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real
4920  dignity in whaling.
4921  
4922  _No dignity in whaling?_ The dignity of our calling the very heavens
4923  attest. Cetus is a constellation in the South! No more! Drive down your
4924  hat in presence of the Czar, and take it off to Queequeg! No more! I
4925  know a man that, in his lifetime, has taken three hundred and fifty
4926  whales. I account that man more honorable than that great captain of
4927  antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns.
4928  
4929  And, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet
4930  undiscovered prime thing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real repute
4931  in that small but high hushed world which I might not be unreasonably
4932  ambitious of; if hereafter I shall do anything that, upon the whole, a
4933  man might rather have done than to have left undone; if, at my death,
4934  my executors, or more properly my creditors, find any precious MSS. in
4935  my desk, then here I prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory
4936  to whaling; for a whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.
4937  
4938  
4939  CHAPTER 25. Postscript.
4940  
4941  In behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but
4942  substantiated facts. But after embattling his facts, an advocate who
4943  should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell
4944  eloquently upon his cause—such an advocate, would he not be
4945  blameworthy?
4946  
4947  It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even
4948  modern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their
4949  functions is gone through. There is a saltcellar of state, so called,
4950  and there may be a castor of state. How they use the salt,
4951  precisely—who knows? Certain I am, however, that a king’s head is
4952  solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it be,
4953  though, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run
4954  well, as they anoint machinery? Much might be ruminated here,
4955  concerning the essential dignity of this regal process, because in
4956  common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints
4957  his hair, and palpably smells of that anointing. In truth, a mature man
4958  who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally, that man has probably got a
4959  quoggy spot in him somewhere. As a general rule, he can’t amount to
4960  much in his totality.
4961  
4962  But the only thing to be considered here, is this—what kind of oil is
4963  used at coronations? Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar
4964  oil, nor castor oil, nor bear’s oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil.
4965  What then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured,
4966  unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?
4967  
4968  Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and
4969  queens with coronation stuff!
4970  
4971  
4972  CHAPTER 26. Knights and Squires.
4973  
4974  The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a
4975  Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an
4976  icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being
4977  hard as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood
4978  would not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time
4979  of general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which
4980  his state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those
4981  summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his
4982  thinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties
4983  and cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. It was
4984  merely the condensation of the man. He was by no means ill-looking;
4985  quite the contrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and
4986  closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength,
4987  like a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for
4988  long ages to come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow
4989  or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was
4990  warranted to do well in all climates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed
4991  to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he
4992  had calmly confronted through life. A staid, steadfast man, whose life
4993  for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame
4994  chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there
4995  were certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in some
4996  cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly
4997  conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence,
4998  the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline
4999  him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some
5000  organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than
5001  from ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And
5002  if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more
5003  did his far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child,
5004  tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature,
5005  and open him still further to those latent influences which, in some
5006  honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often
5007  evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. “I
5008  will have no man in my boat,” said Starbuck, “who is not afraid of a
5009  whale.” By this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and
5010  useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the
5011  encountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more
5012  dangerous comrade than a coward.
5013  
5014  “Aye, aye,” said Stubb, the second mate, “Starbuck, there, is as
5015  careful a man as you’ll find anywhere in this fishery.” But we shall
5016  ere long see what that word “careful” precisely means when used by a
5017  man like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.
5018  
5019  Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a
5020  sentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon
5021  all mortally practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in
5022  this business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits
5023  of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly
5024  wasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after
5025  sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted
5026  in fighting him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical
5027  ocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for
5028  theirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew.
5029  What doom was his own father’s? Where, in the bottomless deeps, could
5030  he find the torn limbs of his brother?
5031  
5032  With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain
5033  superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which
5034  could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But
5035  it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such
5036  terrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature
5037  that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in
5038  him, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its
5039  confinement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it
5040  was that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which,
5041  while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or
5042  whales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet
5043  cannot withstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors,
5044  which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged
5045  and mighty man.
5046  
5047  But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete
5048  abasement of poor Starbuck’s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart
5049  to write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose
5050  the fall of valour in the soul. Men may seem detestable as joint
5051  stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be;
5052  men may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble
5053  and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any
5054  ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their
5055  costliest robes. That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so
5056  far within us, that it remains intact though all the outer character
5057  seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a
5058  valor-ruined man. Nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight,
5059  completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars. But
5060  this august dignity I treat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes,
5061  but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture. Thou shalt
5062  see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike; that
5063  democratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates without end from God;
5064  Himself! The great God absolute! The centre and circumference of all
5065  democracy! His omnipresence, our divine equality!
5066  
5067  If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall
5068  hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic
5069  graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased, among
5070  them all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall
5071  touch that workman’s arm with some ethereal light; if I shall spread a
5072  rainbow over his disastrous set of sun; then against all mortal critics
5073  bear me out in it, thou just Spirit of Equality, which hast spread one
5074  royal mantle of humanity over all my kind! Bear me out in it, thou
5075  great democratic God! who didst not refuse to the swart convict,
5076  Bunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly
5077  hammered leaves of finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old
5078  Cervantes; Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who
5079  didst hurl him upon a war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a
5080  throne! Thou who, in all Thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest
5081  Thy selectest champions from the kingly commons; bear me out in it, O
5082  God!
5083  
5084  
5085  CHAPTER 27. Knights and Squires.
5086  
5087  Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,
5088  according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky;
5089  neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an
5090  indifferent air; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the
5091  chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged
5092  for the year. Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his
5093  whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his
5094  crew all invited guests. He was as particular about the comfortable
5095  arrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about
5096  the snugness of his box. When close to the whale, in the very
5097  death-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and
5098  off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer. He would hum over his
5099  old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated
5100  monster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted the jaws of death
5101  into an easy chair. What he thought of death itself, there is no
5102  telling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a question;
5103  but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a
5104  comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a
5105  sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there,
5106  about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and
5107  not sooner.
5108  
5109  What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,
5110  unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a
5111  world full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs;
5112  what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that
5113  thing must have been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black
5114  little pipe was one of the regular features of his face. You would
5115  almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his
5116  nose as without his pipe. He kept a whole row of pipes there ready
5117  loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever
5118  he turned in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from
5119  the other to the end of the chapter; then loading them again to be in
5120  readiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed, instead of first putting his
5121  legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his mouth.
5122  
5123  I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his
5124  peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air,
5125  whether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless
5126  miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in
5127  time of the cholera, some people go about with a camphorated
5128  handkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal
5129  tribulations, Stubb’s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of
5130  disinfecting agent.
5131  
5132  The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha’s Vineyard. A
5133  short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales,
5134  who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally
5135  and hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of
5136  honor with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost
5137  was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic
5138  bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of
5139  any possible danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion,
5140  the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least
5141  water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small
5142  application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This
5143  ignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in
5144  the matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a
5145  three years’ voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted
5146  that length of time. As a carpenter’s nails are divided into wrought
5147  nails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. Little Flask
5148  was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. They
5149  called him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could
5150  be well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in
5151  Arctic whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers
5152  inserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions
5153  of those battering seas.
5154  
5155  Now these three mates—Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous men.
5156  They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the
5157  Pequod’s boats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which
5158  Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the
5159  whales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being
5160  armed with their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio
5161  of lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.
5162  
5163  And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic
5164  Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,
5165  who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the
5166  former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and
5167  moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy
5168  and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set
5169  down who the Pequod’s harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of
5170  them belonged.
5171  
5172  First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected
5173  for his squire. But Queequeg is already known.
5174  
5175  Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly
5176  promontory of Martha’s Vineyard, where there still exists the last
5177  remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the
5178  neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring
5179  harpooneers. In the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of
5180  Gay-Headers. Tashtego’s long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones,
5181  and black rounding eyes—for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but
5182  Antarctic in their glittering expression—all this sufficiently
5183  proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud
5184  warrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England moose, had
5185  scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main. But no longer
5186  snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland, Tashtego now
5187  hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea; the unerring harpoon
5188  of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires. To look
5189  at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would almost have
5190  credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans, and
5191  half-believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers
5192  of the Air. Tashtego was Stubb the second mate’s squire.
5193  
5194  Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black
5195  negro-savage, with a lion-like tread—an Ahasuerus to behold. Suspended
5196  from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called
5197  them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to
5198  them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,
5199  lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been
5200  anywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors
5201  most frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold
5202  life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what
5203  manner of men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues,
5204  and erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six
5205  feet five in his socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at
5206  him; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to
5207  beg truce of a fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro,
5208  Ahasuerus Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a
5209  chess-man beside him. As for the residue of the Pequod’s company, be it
5210  said, that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men
5211  before the mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans
5212  born, though pretty nearly all the officers are. Herein it is the same
5213  with the American whale fishery as with the American army and military
5214  and merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the
5215  construction of the American Canals and Railroads. The same, I say,
5216  because in all these cases the native American liberally provides the
5217  brains, the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles. No
5218  small number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores, where the
5219  outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews
5220  from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like manner, the
5221  Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the Shetland
5222  Islands, to receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the passage
5223  homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling,
5224  but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly all
5225  Islanders in the Pequod, _Isolatoes_ too, I call such, not
5226  acknowledging the common continent of men, but each _Isolato_ living on
5227  a separate continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel,
5228  what a set these Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from
5229  all the isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying
5230  Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the world’s grievances before that bar
5231  from which not very many of them ever come back. Black Little Pip—he
5232  never did—oh, no! he went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim
5233  Pequod’s forecastle, ye shall ere long see him, beating his tambourine;
5234  prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for, to the great quarter-deck
5235  on high, he was bid strike in with angels, and beat his tambourine in
5236  glory; called a coward here, hailed a hero there!
5237  
5238  
5239  CHAPTER 28. Ahab.
5240  
5241  For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was
5242  seen of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the
5243  watches, and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed
5244  to be the only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from
5245  the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was
5246  plain they but commanded vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and
5247  dictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to
5248  penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.
5249  
5250  Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly
5251  gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague
5252  disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the
5253  sea, became almost a perturbation. This was strangely heightened at
5254  times by the ragged Elijah’s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly
5255  recurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived
5256  of. But poorly could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was
5257  almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish
5258  prophet of the wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or
5259  uneasiness—to call it so—which I felt, yet whenever I came to look
5260  about me in the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such
5261  emotions. For though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew,
5262  were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the
5263  tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me
5264  acquainted with, still I ascribed this—and rightly ascribed it—to the
5265  fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation
5266  in which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the
5267  aspect of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was
5268  most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and
5269  induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage.
5270  Three better, more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own
5271  different way, could not readily be found, and they were every one of
5272  them Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being
5273  Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had
5274  biting Polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the
5275  southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed,
5276  gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable
5277  weather behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey
5278  and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the
5279  ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping
5280  and melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of
5281  the forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the
5282  taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension;
5283  Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.
5284  
5285  There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the
5286  recovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when
5287  the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them,
5288  or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His
5289  whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an
5290  unalterable mould, like Cellini’s cast Perseus. Threading its way out
5291  from among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his
5292  tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you
5293  saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that
5294  perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a
5295  great tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and
5296  without wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from
5297  top to bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still
5298  greenly alive, but branded. Whether that mark was born with him, or
5299  whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could
5300  certainly say. By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or
5301  no allusion was made to it, especially by the mates. But once
5302  Tashtego’s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew,
5303  superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did
5304  Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the
5305  fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this
5306  wild hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman
5307  insinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out
5308  of Nantucket, had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless,
5309  the old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested
5310  this old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no
5311  white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever
5312  Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out—which might hardly come to
5313  pass, so he muttered—then, whoever should do that last office for the
5314  dead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.
5315  
5316  So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the
5317  livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly
5318  noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the
5319  barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood. It had previously come
5320  to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished
5321  bone of the sperm whale’s jaw. “Aye, he was dismasted off Japan,” said
5322  the old Gay-Head Indian once; “but like his dismasted craft, he shipped
5323  another mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of ’em.”
5324  
5325  I was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of
5326  the Pequod’s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,
5327  there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the
5328  plank. His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and
5329  holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out
5330  beyond the ship’s ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest
5331  fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and
5332  fearless, forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor
5333  did his officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest
5334  gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not
5335  painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not
5336  only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion
5337  in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some
5338  mighty woe.
5339  
5340  Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin.
5341  But after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either
5342  standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or
5343  heavily walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to
5344  grow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if,
5345  when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry
5346  bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it
5347  came to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet,
5348  for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he
5349  seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was only
5350  making a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling
5351  preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so
5352  that there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite
5353  Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that
5354  layer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose
5355  the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.
5356  
5357  Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the
5358  pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him
5359  from his mood. For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and
5360  May, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest,
5361  ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some
5362  few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did,
5363  in the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish
5364  air. More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look,
5365  which, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.
5366  
5367  
5368  CHAPTER 29. Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.
5369  
5370  Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went
5371  rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost
5372  perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the
5373  Tropic. The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,
5374  redundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped
5375  up—flaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights
5376  seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely
5377  pride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted
5378  suns! For sleeping man, ’twas hard to choose between such winsome days
5379  and such seducing nights. But all the witcheries of that unwaning
5380  weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward
5381  world. Inward they turned upon the soul, especially when the still mild
5382  hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as the clear ice
5383  most forms of noiseless twilights. And all these subtle agencies, more
5384  and more they wrought on Ahab’s texture.
5385  
5386  Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less
5387  man has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders,
5388  the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the
5389  night-cloaked deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he
5390  seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits
5391  were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. “It feels
5392  like going down into one’s tomb,”—he would mutter to himself—“for an
5393  old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my
5394  grave-dug berth.”
5395  
5396  So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were
5397  set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below;
5398  and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors
5399  flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt
5400  it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when
5401  this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the
5402  silent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old
5403  man would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled
5404  way. Some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like
5405  these, he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because
5406  to his wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory
5407  heel, such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony
5408  step, that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of
5409  sharks. But once, the mood was on him too deep for common regardings;
5410  and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from
5411  taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came up from below,
5412  with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if
5413  Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say
5414  nay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting
5415  something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the
5416  insertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know
5417  Ahab then.
5418  
5419  “Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,” said Ahab, “that thou wouldst wad me that
5420  fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave;
5421  where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at
5422  last.—Down, dog, and kennel!”
5423  
5424  Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly
5425  scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly,
5426  “I am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half
5427  like it, sir.”
5428  
5429  “Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away,
5430  as if to avoid some passionate temptation.
5431  
5432  “No, sir; not yet,” said Stubb, emboldened, “I will not tamely be
5433  called a dog, sir.”
5434  
5435  “Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone,
5436  or I’ll clear the world of thee!”
5437  
5438  As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors
5439  in his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.
5440  
5441  “I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,”
5442  muttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. “It’s
5443  very queer. Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don’t well know whether to go
5444  back and strike him, or—what’s that?—down here on my knees and pray for
5445  him? Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the
5446  first time I ever _did_ pray. It’s queer; very queer; and he’s queer
5447  too; aye, take him fore and aft, he’s about the queerest old man Stubb
5448  ever sailed with. How he flashed at me!—his eyes like powder-pans! is
5449  he mad? Anyway there’s something on his mind, as sure as there must be
5450  something on a deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either,
5451  more than three hours out of the twenty-four; and he don’t sleep then.
5452  Didn’t that Dough-Boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning he always
5453  finds the old man’s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the
5454  sheets down at the foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and
5455  the pillow a sort of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on
5456  it? A hot old man! I guess he’s got what some folks ashore call a
5457  conscience; it’s a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say—worse nor a
5458  toothache. Well, well; I don’t know what it is, but the Lord keep me
5459  from catching it. He’s full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the
5460  after hold for, every night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what’s
5461  that for, I should like to know? Who’s made appointments with him in
5462  the hold? Ain’t that queer, now? But there’s no telling, it’s the old
5463  game—Here goes for a snooze. Damn me, it’s worth a fellow’s while to be
5464  born into the world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think
5465  of it, that’s about the first thing babies do, and that’s a sort of
5466  queer, too. Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of ’em.
5467  But that’s against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh
5468  commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth—So here goes again.
5469  But how’s that? didn’t he call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten times
5470  a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of _that!_ He might as
5471  well have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he _did_ kick me, and I
5472  didn’t observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow. It
5473  flashed like a bleached bone. What the devil’s the matter with me? I
5474  don’t stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort
5475  of turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming,
5476  though—How? how? how?—but the only way’s to stash it; so here goes to
5477  hammock again; and in the morning, I’ll see how this plaguey juggling
5478  thinks over by daylight.”
5479  
5480  
5481  CHAPTER 30. The Pipe.
5482  
5483  When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the
5484  bulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a
5485  sailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also
5486  his pipe. Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool
5487  on the weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.
5488  
5489  In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were
5490  fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How could
5491  one look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without
5492  bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of the plank,
5493  and a king of the sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.
5494  
5495  Some moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth
5496  in quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. “How
5497  now,” he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, “this smoking no
5498  longer soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be
5499  gone! Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring—aye, and
5500  ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with
5501  such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were
5502  the strongest and fullest of trouble. What business have I with this
5503  pipe? This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white
5504  vapors among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like
5505  mine. I’ll smoke no more—”
5506  
5507  He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the
5508  waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe
5509  made. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.
5510  
5511  
5512  CHAPTER 31. Queen Mab.
5513  
5514  Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.
5515  
5516  “Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man’s
5517  ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to
5518  kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And
5519  then, presto! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept
5520  kicking at it. But what was still more curious, Flask—you know how
5521  curious all dreams are—through all this rage that I was in, I somehow
5522  seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an
5523  insult, that kick from Ahab. ‘Why,’ thinks I, ‘what’s the row? It’s not
5524  a real leg, only a false leg.’ And there’s a mighty difference between
5525  a living thump and a dead thump. That’s what makes a blow from the
5526  hand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane.
5527  The living member—that makes the living insult, my little man. And
5528  thinks I to myself all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly
5529  toes against that cursed pyramid—so confoundedly contradictory was it
5530  all, all the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, ‘what’s his leg
5531  now, but a cane—a whalebone cane. Yes,’ thinks I, ‘it was only a
5532  playful cudgelling—in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me—not a
5533  base kick. Besides,’ thinks I, ‘look at it once; why, the end of it—the
5534  foot part—what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed
5535  farmer kicked me, _there’s_ a devilish broad insult. But this insult is
5536  whittled down to a point only.’ But now comes the greatest joke of the
5537  dream, Flask. While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of
5538  badger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the
5539  shoulders, and slews me round. ‘What are you ’bout?’ says he. Slid!
5540  man, but I was frightened. Such a phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was
5541  over the fright. ‘What am I about?’ says I at last. ‘And what business
5542  is that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do _you_ want a
5543  kick?’ By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned
5544  round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he
5545  had for a clout—what do you think, I saw?—why thunder alive, man, his
5546  stern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on
5547  second thoughts, ‘I guess I won’t kick you, old fellow.’ ‘Wise Stubb,’
5548  said he, ‘wise Stubb;’ and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of
5549  eating of his own gums like a chimney hag. Seeing he wasn’t going to
5550  stop saying over his ‘wise Stubb, wise Stubb,’ I thought I might as
5551  well fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I had only just lifted my
5552  foot for it, when he roared out, ‘Stop that kicking!’ ‘Halloa,’ says I,
5553  ‘what’s the matter now, old fellow?’ ‘Look ye here,’ says he; ‘let’s
5554  argue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’
5555  says I—‘right _here_ it was.’ ‘Very good,’ says he—‘he used his ivory
5556  leg, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I. ‘Well then,’ says he, ‘wise
5557  Stubb, what have you to complain of? Didn’t he kick with right good
5558  will? it wasn’t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No, you
5559  were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb. It’s
5560  an honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old England
5561  the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and
5562  made garter-knights of; but, be _your_ boast, Stubb, that ye were
5563  kicked by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; _be_
5564  kicked by him; account his kicks honors; and on no account kick back;
5565  for you can’t help yourself, wise Stubb. Don’t you see that pyramid?’
5566  With that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to
5567  swim off into the air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my
5568  hammock! Now, what do you think of that dream, Flask?”
5569  
5570  “I don’t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.’”
5571  
5572  “May be; may be. But it’s made a wise man of me, Flask. D’ye see Ahab
5573  standing there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing
5574  you can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him,
5575  whatever he says. Halloa! What’s that he shouts? Hark!”
5576  
5577  “Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are whales hereabouts!
5578  
5579  “If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!
5580  
5581  “What do you think of that now, Flask? ain’t there a small drop of
5582  something queer about that, eh? A white whale—did ye mark that, man?
5583  Look ye—there’s something special in the wind. Stand by for it, Flask.
5584  Ahab has that that’s bloody on his mind. But, mum; he comes this way.”
5585  
5586  
5587  CHAPTER 32. Cetology.
5588  
5589  Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost
5590  in its unshored, harbourless immensities. Ere that come to pass; ere
5591  the Pequod’s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of
5592  the leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter
5593  almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the
5594  more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which
5595  are to follow.
5596  
5597  It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera,
5598  that I would now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The
5599  classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here
5600  essayed. Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down.
5601  
5602  “No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled
5603  Cetology,” says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.
5604  
5605  “It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry
5606  as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families.
5607  * * * Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal”
5608  (sperm whale), says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.
5609  
5610  “Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.”
5611  “Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.” “A field
5612  strewn with thorns.” “All these incomplete indications but serve to
5613  torture us naturalists.”
5614  
5615  Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson,
5616  those lights of zoology and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real
5617  knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in
5618  some small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales. Many are
5619  the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at
5620  large or in little, written of the whale. Run over a few:—The Authors
5621  of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner;
5622  Ray; Linnæus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson;
5623  Marten; Lacépède; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick
5624  Cuvier; John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne;
5625  the Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to
5626  what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above
5627  cited extracts will show.
5628  
5629  Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen
5630  ever saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional
5631  harpooneer and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate
5632  subject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing
5633  authority. But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great
5634  sperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy
5635  mentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper
5636  upon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the largest of
5637  the whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the
5638  profound ignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the
5639  then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to
5640  this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats
5641  and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete. Reference
5642  to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past
5643  days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one rival, was
5644  to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has at last come for a
5645  new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people all,—the
5646  Greenland whale is deposed,—the great sperm whale now reigneth!
5647  
5648  There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the
5649  living sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest
5650  degree succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale’s and Bennett’s;
5651  both in their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both
5652  exact and reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to
5653  be found in their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes,
5654  it is of excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific
5655  description. As yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic,
5656  lives not complete in any literature. Far above all other hunted
5657  whales, his is an unwritten life.
5658  
5659  Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular
5660  comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the
5661  present, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent
5662  laborers. As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I
5663  hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise nothing complete;
5664  because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very
5665  reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical
5666  description of the various species, or—in this place at least—to much
5667  of any description. My object here is simply to project the draught of
5668  a systematization of cetology. I am the architect, not the builder.
5669  
5670  But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the
5671  Post-Office is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea
5672  after them; to have one’s hands among the unspeakable foundations,
5673  ribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I
5674  that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful
5675  tauntings in Job might well appal me. Will he (the leviathan) make a
5676  covenant with thee? Behold the hope of him is vain! But I have swam
5677  through libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do with
5678  whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There
5679  are some preliminaries to settle.
5680  
5681  First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology
5682  is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it
5683  still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of
5684  Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnæus declares, “I hereby separate the whales from
5685  the fish.” But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850,
5686  sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnæus’s express edict,
5687  were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the
5688  Leviathan.
5689  
5690  The grounds upon which Linnæus would fain have banished the whales from
5691  the waters, he states as follows: “On account of their warm bilocular
5692  heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem
5693  intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,” and finally, “ex lege naturæ jure
5694  meritoque.” I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley
5695  Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and
5696  they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether
5697  insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.
5698  
5699  Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned
5700  ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.
5701  This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal
5702  respect does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnæus has given
5703  you those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood;
5704  whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.
5705  
5706  Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as
5707  conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a
5708  whale is _a spouting fish with a horizontal tail_. There you have him.
5709  However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded
5710  meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a
5711  fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is
5712  still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have
5713  noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a
5714  vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail,
5715  though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal
5716  position.
5717  
5718  By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude
5719  from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified
5720  with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other
5721  hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as
5722  alien.* Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish
5723  must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the
5724  grand divisions of the entire whale host.
5725  
5726  *I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and
5727  Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are
5728  included by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish
5729  are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers,
5730  and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny
5731  their credentials as whales; and have presented them with their
5732  passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.
5733  
5734  First: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary
5735  BOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them
5736  all, both small and large.
5737  
5738  I. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.
5739  
5740  As the type of the FOLIO I present the _Sperm Whale_; of the OCTAVO,
5741  the _Grampus_; of the DUODECIMO, the _Porpoise_.
5742  
5743  FOLIOS. Among these I here include the following chapters:—I. The
5744  _Sperm Whale_; II. the _Right Whale_; III. the _Fin-Back Whale_; IV.
5745  the _Hump-backed Whale_; V. the _Razor Back Whale_; VI. the _Sulphur
5746  Bottom Whale_.
5747  
5748  BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER I. (_Sperm Whale_).—This whale, among the
5749  English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter
5750  whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the
5751  French, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the
5752  Long Words. He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe;
5753  the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in
5754  aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being the
5755  only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is
5756  obtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged
5757  upon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically
5758  considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was
5759  almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil
5760  was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days
5761  spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a
5762  creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland
5763  or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was
5764  that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable
5765  of the word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was
5766  exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment
5767  and medicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you
5768  nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of
5769  time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was
5770  still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a
5771  notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation
5772  must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this
5773  spermaceti was really derived.
5774  
5775  BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER II. (_Right Whale_).—In one respect this is
5776  the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly
5777  hunted by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or
5778  baleen; and the oil specially known as “whale oil,” an inferior article
5779  in commerce. Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by
5780  all the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black
5781  Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a
5782  deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus
5783  multitudinously baptised. What then is the whale, which I include in
5784  the second species of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the
5785  English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen; the
5786  Baleine Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the
5787  Swedes. It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been
5788  hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale
5789  which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on
5790  the Brazil Banks, on the Nor’ West Coast, and various other parts of
5791  the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.
5792  
5793  Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the
5794  English and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree
5795  in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single
5796  determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is by
5797  endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that
5798  some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate.
5799  The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with
5800  reference to elucidating the sperm whale.
5801  
5802  BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER III. (_Fin-Back_).—Under this head I reckon
5803  a monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and
5804  Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale
5805  whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the
5806  Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and
5807  in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less
5808  portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great
5809  lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting
5810  folds of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin,
5811  from which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin
5812  is some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder
5813  part of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed
5814  end. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible,
5815  this isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the
5816  surface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with
5817  spherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows
5818  upon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery
5819  circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and
5820  wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes
5821  back. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some
5822  men are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly
5823  rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his
5824  straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear
5825  upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in
5826  swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan seems
5827  the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark
5828  that style upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the
5829  Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic
5830  species denominated _Whalebone whales_, that is, whales with baleen. Of
5831  these so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several
5832  varieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed whales
5833  and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed
5834  whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen’s names for a few sorts.
5835  
5836  In connection with this appellative of “Whalebone whales,” it is of
5837  great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be
5838  convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is
5839  in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded
5840  upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that
5841  those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to
5842  afford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other
5843  detached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents.
5844  How then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose
5845  peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales,
5846  without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in
5847  other and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the
5848  humpbacked whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.
5849  Then, this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these
5850  has baleen; but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the
5851  same with the other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales,
5852  they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of
5853  them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all
5854  general methodization formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one
5855  of the whale-naturalists has split.
5856  
5857  But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the
5858  whale, in his anatomy—there, at least, we shall be able to hit the
5859  right classification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the
5860  Greenland whale’s anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have
5861  seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the
5862  Greenland whale. And if you descend into the bowels of the various
5863  leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as
5864  available to the systematizer as those external ones already
5865  enumerated. What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales
5866  bodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way.
5867  And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and it is the only
5868  one that can possibly succeed, for it alone is practicable. To proceed.
5869  
5870  BOOK I. (_Folio_) CHAPTER IV. (_Hump Back_).—This whale is often seen
5871  on the northern American coast. He has been frequently captured there,
5872  and towed into harbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or
5873  you might call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the
5874  popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the
5875  sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very
5876  valuable. He has baleen. He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of
5877  all the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any
5878  other of them.
5879  
5880  BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER V. (_Razor Back_).—Of this whale little is
5881  known but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a
5882  retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no
5883  coward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which
5884  rises in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little more of him, nor
5885  does anybody else.
5886  
5887  BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER VI. (_Sulphur Bottom_).—Another retiring
5888  gentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the
5889  Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings. He is seldom seen;
5890  at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and
5891  then always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is
5892  never chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are
5893  told of him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true
5894  of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.
5895  
5896  Thus ends BOOK I. (_Folio_), and now begins BOOK II. (_Octavo_).
5897  
5898  OCTAVOES.*—These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among which
5899  present may be numbered:—I., the _Grampus_; II., the _Black Fish_;
5900  III., the _Narwhale_; IV., the _Thrasher_; V., the _Killer_.
5901  
5902  *Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.
5903  Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of
5904  the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them
5905  in figure, yet the bookbinder’s Quarto volume in its dimensioned form
5906  does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume
5907  does.
5908  
5909  BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER I. (_Grampus_).—Though this fish, whose
5910  loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to
5911  landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not
5912  popularly classed among whales. But possessing all the grand
5913  distinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised
5914  him for one. He is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to
5915  twenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the
5916  waist. He swims in herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil
5917  is considerable in quantity, and pretty good for light. By some
5918  fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the
5919  great sperm whale.
5920  
5921  BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER II. (_Black Fish_).—I give the popular
5922  fishermen’s names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.
5923  Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and
5924  suggest another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called,
5925  because blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the
5926  Hyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and from the
5927  circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he
5928  carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale
5929  averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost
5930  all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin
5931  in swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more
5932  profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the
5933  Hyena whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic
5934  employment—as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and
5935  quite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.
5936  Though their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you
5937  upwards of thirty gallons of oil.
5938  
5939  BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER III. (_Narwhale_), that is, _Nostril
5940  whale_.—Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose
5941  from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The
5942  creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five
5943  feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly
5944  speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw
5945  in a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found
5946  on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner
5947  something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What
5948  precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to
5949  say. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and
5950  bill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for
5951  a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin
5952  said it was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the
5953  surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his
5954  horn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these
5955  surmises to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided
5956  horn may really be used by the Narwhale—however that may be—it would
5957  certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets.
5958  The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale,
5959  and the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious example of the
5960  Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From
5961  certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same
5962  sea-unicorn’s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote
5963  against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices.
5964  It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same
5965  way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn.
5966  Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity.
5967  Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that
5968  voyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him
5969  from a window of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the
5970  Thames; “when Sir Martin returned from that voyage,” saith Black
5971  Letter, “on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long
5972  horn of the Narwhale, which for a long period after hung in the castle
5973  at Windsor.” An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on
5974  bended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn,
5975  pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature.
5976  
5977  The Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a
5978  milk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black.
5979  His oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it,
5980  and he is seldom hunted. He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.
5981  
5982  BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER IV. (_Killer_).—Of this whale little is
5983  precisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed
5984  naturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say
5985  that he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage—a sort of
5986  Feegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip, and
5987  hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death.
5988  The Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has.
5989  Exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the
5990  ground of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on
5991  sea; Bonapartes and Sharks included.
5992  
5993  BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER V. (_Thrasher_).—This gentleman is famous
5994  for his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He
5995  mounts the Folio whale’s back, and as he swims, he works his passage by
5996  flogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar
5997  process. Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both
5998  are outlaws, even in the lawless seas.
5999  
6000   Thus ends BOOK II. (_Octavo_), and begins BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_).
6001  
6002  DUODECIMOES.—These include the smaller whales. I. The Huzza Porpoise.
6003  II. The Algerine Porpoise. III. The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.
6004  
6005  To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may
6006  possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five
6007  feet should be marshalled among WHALES—a word, which, in the popular
6008  sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures set down
6009  above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of my
6010  definition of what a whale is—_i.e._ a spouting fish, with a horizontal
6011  tail.
6012  
6013  BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER 1. (_Huzza Porpoise_).—This is the
6014  common porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own
6015  bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something
6016  must be done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always
6017  swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing
6018  themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their
6019  appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of
6020  fine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward.
6021  They are the lads that always live before the wind. They are accounted
6022  a lucky omen. If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding
6023  these vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit of godly
6024  gamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise will yield
6025  you one good gallon of good oil. But the fine and delicate fluid
6026  extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in request among
6027  jewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones. Porpoise meat
6028  is good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you that a
6029  porpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very
6030  readily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him;
6031  and you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.
6032  
6033  BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER II. (_Algerine Porpoise_).—A pirate.
6034  Very savage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat
6035  larger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make.
6036  Provoke him, and he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many
6037  times, but never yet saw him captured.
6038  
6039  BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER III. (_Mealy-mouthed Porpoise_).—The
6040  largest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it
6041  is known. The only English name, by which he has hitherto been
6042  designated, is that of the fishers—Right-Whale Porpoise, from the
6043  circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In
6044  shape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a
6045  less rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and
6046  gentleman-like figure. He has no fins on his back (most other porpoises
6047  have), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel
6048  hue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all. Though his entire back down to his
6049  side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark
6050  in a ship’s hull, called the “bright waist,” that line streaks him from
6051  stem to stern, with two separate colours, black above and white below.
6052  The white comprises part of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which
6053  makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a
6054  meal-bag. A most mean and mealy aspect! His oil is much like that of
6055  the common porpoise.
6056  
6057    * * * * * *
6058  
6059  Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the
6060  Porpoise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the
6061  Leviathans of note. But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive,
6062  half-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by
6063  reputation, but not personally. I shall enumerate them by their
6064  fore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to
6065  future investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun. If
6066  any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then
6067  he can readily be incorporated into this System, according to his
6068  Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:—The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk
6069  Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the
6070  Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale;
6071  the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc. From Icelandic,
6072  Dutch, and old English authorities, there might be quoted other lists
6073  of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names. But I
6074  omit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help suspecting them
6075  for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing.
6076  
6077  Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be
6078  here, and at once, perfected. You cannot but plainly see that I have
6079  kept my word. But I now leave my cetological System standing thus
6080  unfinished, even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the
6081  crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower. For small
6082  erections may be finished by their first architects; grand ones, true
6083  ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity. God keep me from ever
6084  completing anything. This whole book is but a draught—nay, but the
6085  draught of a draught. Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!
6086  
6087  
6088  CHAPTER 33. The Specksnyder.
6089  
6090  Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place
6091  as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising
6092  from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown
6093  of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.
6094  
6095  The large importance attached to the harpooneer’s vocation is evinced
6096  by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries
6097  and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the
6098  person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an
6099  officer called the Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter;
6100  usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In
6101  those days, the captain’s authority was restricted to the navigation
6102  and general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting
6103  department and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer
6104  reigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted
6105  title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but
6106  his former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply as
6107  senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain’s more
6108  inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the
6109  harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since
6110  in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the
6111  boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling
6112  ground) the command of the ship’s deck is also his; therefore the grand
6113  political maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart
6114  from the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their
6115  professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as
6116  their social equal.
6117  
6118  Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is
6119  this—the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and
6120  merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and
6121  so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in
6122  the after part of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in
6123  the captain’s cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with
6124  it.
6125  
6126  Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest
6127  of all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and
6128  the community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high
6129  or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their
6130  common luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and
6131  hard work; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a
6132  less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind
6133  how much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some
6134  primitive instances, live together; for all that, the punctilious
6135  externals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed,
6136  and in no instance done away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in
6137  which you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated
6138  grandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as
6139  much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the
6140  shabbiest of pilot-cloth.
6141  
6142  And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least
6143  given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage
6144  he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he
6145  required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the
6146  quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to peculiar
6147  circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he
6148  addressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or _in
6149  terrorem_, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means
6150  unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.
6151  
6152  Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind
6153  those forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself;
6154  incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than
6155  they were legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of
6156  his brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested;
6157  through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an
6158  irresistible dictatorship. For be a man’s intellectual superiority what
6159  it will, it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over
6160  other men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and
6161  entrenchments, always, in themselves, more or less paltry and base.
6162  This it is, that for ever keeps God’s true princes of the Empire from
6163  the world’s hustings; and leaves the highest honors that this air can
6164  give, to those men who become famous more through their infinite
6165  inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert, than
6166  through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass.
6167  Such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political
6168  superstitions invest them, that in some royal instances even to idiot
6169  imbecility they have imparted potency. But when, as in the case of
6170  Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an
6171  imperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before the
6172  tremendous centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist who would
6173  depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing,
6174  ever forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one
6175  now alluded to.
6176  
6177  But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket
6178  grimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and
6179  Kings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old
6180  whale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings
6181  and housings are denied me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it
6182  must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and
6183  featured in the unbodied air!
6184  
6185  
6186  CHAPTER 34. The Cabin-Table.
6187  
6188  It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale
6189  loaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord
6190  and master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking
6191  an observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on
6192  the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on
6193  the upper part of his ivory leg. From his complete inattention to the
6194  tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But
6195  presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the
6196  deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, “Dinner, Mr.
6197  Starbuck,” disappears into the cabin.
6198  
6199  When the last echo of his sultan’s step has died away, and Starbuck,
6200  the first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then
6201  Starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks,
6202  and, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of
6203  pleasantness, “Dinner, Mr. Stubb,” and descends the scuttle. The second
6204  Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the
6205  main brace, to see whether it will be all right with that important
6206  rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a rapid “Dinner,
6207  Mr. Flask,” follows after his predecessors.
6208  
6209  But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,
6210  seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all
6211  sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his
6212  shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right
6213  over the Grand Turk’s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching
6214  his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so
6215  far at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other
6216  processions, by bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into
6217  the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and,
6218  then, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab’s presence,
6219  in the character of Abjectus, or the Slave.
6220  
6221  It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense
6222  artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck
6223  some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and
6224  defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those
6225  very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that
6226  same commander’s cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say
6227  deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the
6228  table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this
6229  difference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of
6230  Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously,
6231  therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he
6232  who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own
6233  private dinner-table of invited guests, that man’s unchallenged power
6234  and dominion of individual influence for the time; that man’s royalty
6235  of state transcends Belshazzar’s, for Belshazzar was not the greatest.
6236  Who has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be Cæsar.
6237  It is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding.
6238  Now, if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a
6239  ship-master, then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that
6240  peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.
6241  
6242  Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion
6243  on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still
6244  deferential cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be
6245  served. They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab,
6246  there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. With one mind,
6247  their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man’s knife, as he carved
6248  the chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for the world they
6249  would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even
6250  upon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And when reaching out his
6251  knife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab
6252  thereby motioned Starbuck’s plate towards him, the mate received his
6253  meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little
6254  started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed
6255  it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection. For, like
6256  the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor
6257  profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals
6258  were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old
6259  Ahab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a relief
6260  it was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold
6261  below. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy
6262  of this weary family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef;
6263  his would have been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help
6264  himself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the
6265  first degree. Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never
6266  more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;
6267  nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask
6268  helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it.
6269  Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether he
6270  thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on account of its
6271  clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so
6272  long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and
6273  therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas!
6274  was a butterless man!
6275  
6276  Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask
6277  is the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask’s dinner was badly
6278  jammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him;
6279  and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb
6280  even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small
6281  appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask
6282  must bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls that
6283  day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the
6284  deck. Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that ever
6285  since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he
6286  had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less.
6287  For what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal
6288  in him. Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed
6289  from my stomach. I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of
6290  old-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before
6291  the mast. There’s the fruits of promotion now; there’s the vanity of
6292  glory: there’s the insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any
6293  mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask’s
6294  official capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample
6295  vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask
6296  through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before
6297  awful Ahab.
6298  
6299  Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table
6300  in the Pequod’s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted
6301  order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was
6302  restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the
6303  three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary
6304  legatees. They made a sort of temporary servants’ hall of the high and
6305  mighty cabin.
6306  
6307  In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless
6308  invisible domineerings of the captain’s table, was the entire care-free
6309  license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior
6310  fellows the harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid
6311  of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed
6312  their food with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined
6313  like lords; they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading
6314  with spices. Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that
6315  to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale
6316  Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly
6317  quarried out of the solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he
6318  did not go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an
6319  ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back,
6320  harpoon-wise. And once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted
6321  Dough-Boy’s memory by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head
6322  into a great empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand,
6323  began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him. He was
6324  naturally a very nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow, this
6325  bread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital
6326  nurse. And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab,
6327  and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages,
6328  Dough-Boy’s whole life was one continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after
6329  seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded, he
6330  would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and
6331  fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door, till all was
6332  over.
6333  
6334  It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing
6335  his filed teeth to the Indian’s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on
6336  the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the
6337  low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low
6338  cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in
6339  a ship. But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,
6340  not to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively
6341  small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so
6342  broad, baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage
6343  fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through
6344  his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by
6345  beef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a
6346  mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating—an ugly sound enough—so
6347  much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any
6348  marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear
6349  Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might
6350  be picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery
6351  hanging round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor
6352  did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for
6353  their lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner,
6354  they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did
6355  not at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget
6356  that in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been
6357  guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy!
6358  hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin
6359  should he carry on his arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to his
6360  great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to
6361  his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling
6362  in them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.
6363  
6364  But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived
6365  there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were
6366  scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time,
6367  when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.
6368  
6369  In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale
6370  captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights
6371  the ship’s cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that
6372  anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth,
6373  the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to
6374  have lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it
6375  was something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for a
6376  moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing,
6377  residing in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin
6378  was no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally
6379  included in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He
6380  lived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled
6381  Missouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan
6382  of the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the
6383  winter there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old
6384  age, Ahab’s soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed
6385  upon the sullen paws of its gloom!
6386  
6387  
6388  CHAPTER 35. The Mast-Head.
6389  
6390  It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the
6391  other seamen my first mast-head came round.
6392  
6393  In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost
6394  simultaneously with the vessel’s leaving her port; even though she may
6395  have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper
6396  cruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years’ voyage she
6397  is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her—say, an empty vial
6398  even—then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her
6399  skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether
6400  relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.
6401  
6402  Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a
6403  very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate
6404  here. I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old
6405  Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them.
6406  For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by
6407  their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia,
6408  or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great
6409  stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the
6410  dread gale of God’s wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel
6411  builders priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a
6412  nation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general
6413  belief among archæologists, that the first pyramids were founded for
6414  astronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar
6415  stair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with
6416  prodigious long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were
6417  wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the
6418  look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing
6419  in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of old times,
6420  who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole
6421  latter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the
6422  ground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a
6423  dauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his
6424  place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing
6425  everything out to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern
6426  standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,
6427  and bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,
6428  are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon
6429  discovering any strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of
6430  the column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and
6431  fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;
6432  whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great
6433  Washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in
6434  Baltimore, and like one of Hercules’ pillars, his column marks that
6435  point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go. Admiral
6436  Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in
6437  Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,
6438  token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is
6439  smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor
6440  Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to
6441  befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze;
6442  however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the
6443  thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be
6444  shunned.
6445  
6446  It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head
6447  standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not
6448  so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole
6449  historian of Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us,
6450  that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly
6451  launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected
6452  lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by
6453  means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house.
6454  A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New
6455  Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned
6456  boats nigh the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we
6457  then to the one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The
6458  three mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen
6459  taking their regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other
6460  every two hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly
6461  pleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is
6462  delightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks,
6463  striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while
6464  beneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters
6465  of the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous
6466  Colossus at old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of
6467  the sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship
6468  indolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you
6469  into languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime
6470  uneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras
6471  with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into
6472  unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt
6473  securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what
6474  you shall have for dinner—for all your meals for three years and more
6475  are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.
6476  
6477  In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years’
6478  voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the
6479  mast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be
6480  deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion
6481  of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of
6482  anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a
6483  comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock,
6484  a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small
6485  and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your
6486  most usual point of perch is the head of the t’ gallant-mast, where you
6487  stand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen)
6488  called the t’ gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the
6489  beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull’s horns. To
6490  be sure, in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in
6491  the shape of a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest
6492  watch-coat is no more of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul
6493  is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about
6494  in it, nor even move out of it, without running great risk of perishing
6495  (like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a
6496  watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or
6497  additional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of
6498  drawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of
6499  your watch-coat.
6500  
6501  Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a
6502  southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or
6503  pulpits, called _crow’s-nests_, in which the look-outs of a Greenland
6504  whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In
6505  the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled “A Voyage among the
6506  Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the
6507  re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;” in this
6508  admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a
6509  charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented
6510  _crow’s-nest_ of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet’s
6511  good craft. He called it the _Sleet’s crow’s-nest_, in honor of
6512  himself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all
6513  ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children
6514  after our own names (we fathers being the original inventors and
6515  patentees), so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other
6516  apparatus we may beget. In shape, the Sleet’s crow’s-nest is something
6517  like a large tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is
6518  furnished with a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head
6519  in a hard gale. Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into
6520  it through a little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or
6521  side next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker
6522  underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather
6523  rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and
6524  other nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his
6525  mast-head in this crow’s-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a
6526  rifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask
6527  and shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or
6528  vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot
6529  successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the
6530  water, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it
6531  was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does,
6532  all the little detailed conveniences of his crow’s-nest; but though he
6533  so enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very
6534  scientific account of his experiments in this crow’s-nest, with a small
6535  compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors
6536  resulting from what is called the “local attraction” of all binnacle
6537  magnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in
6538  the ship’s planks, and in the Glacier’s case, perhaps, to there having
6539  been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though
6540  the Captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his
6541  learned “binnacle deviations,” “azimuth compass observations,” and
6542  “approximate errors,” he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was
6543  not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail
6544  being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little
6545  case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow’s nest, within
6546  easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire and
6547  even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it
6548  very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle,
6549  seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been, while
6550  with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics
6551  aloft there in that bird’s nest within three or four perches of the
6552  pole.
6553  
6554  But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as
6555  Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is
6556  greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those
6557  seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used
6558  to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a
6559  chat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there;
6560  then ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the
6561  top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so
6562  at last mount to my ultimate destination.
6563  
6564  Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept
6565  but sorry guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how
6566  could I—being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering
6567  altitude—how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all
6568  whale-ships’ standing orders, “Keep your weather eye open, and sing out
6569  every time.”
6570  
6571  And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of
6572  Nantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with
6573  lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who
6574  offers to ship with the Phædon instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware
6575  of such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before they can be
6576  killed; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes
6577  round the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer. Nor
6578  are these monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the whale-fishery
6579  furnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded
6580  young men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking
6581  sentiment in tar and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches
6582  himself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship,
6583  and in moody phrase ejaculates:—
6584  
6585  
6586  “Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! Ten thousand
6587  blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.”
6588  
6589  
6590  
6591  Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young
6592  philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient
6593  “interest” in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost
6594  to all honorable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would
6595  rather not see whales than otherwise. But all in vain; those young
6596  Platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect; they are
6597  short-sighted; what use, then, to strain the visual nerve? They have
6598  left their opera-glasses at home.
6599  
6600  “Why, thou monkey,” said a harpooneer to one of these lads, “we’ve been
6601  cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale
6602  yet. Whales are scarce as hen’s teeth whenever thou art up here.”
6603  Perhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in
6604  the far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of
6605  vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending
6606  cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he loses his identity;
6607  takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep,
6608  blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every strange,
6609  half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every
6610  dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems to him
6611  the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by
6612  continually flitting through it. In this enchanted mood, thy spirit
6613  ebbs away to whence it came; becomes diffused through time and space;
6614  like Cranmer’s sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of
6615  every shore the round globe over.
6616  
6617  There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a
6618  gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from
6619  the inscrutable tides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on
6620  ye, move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your
6621  identity comes back in horror. Over Descartian vortices you hover. And
6622  perhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled
6623  shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea, no
6624  more to rise for ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!
6625  
6626  
6627  CHAPTER 36. The Quarter-Deck.
6628  
6629  (_Enter Ahab: Then, all._)
6630  
6631  It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one morning
6632  shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the
6633  cabin-gangway to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk at that
6634  hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in
6635  the garden.
6636  
6637  Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old
6638  rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over
6639  dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did
6640  you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also,
6641  you would see still stranger foot-prints—the foot-prints of his one
6642  unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.
6643  
6644  But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his
6645  nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his
6646  thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the
6647  main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought
6648  turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely
6649  possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of
6650  every outer movement.
6651  
6652  “D’ye mark him, Flask?” whispered Stubb; “the chick that’s in him pecks
6653  the shell. ’Twill soon be out.”
6654  
6655  The hours wore on;—Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing the
6656  deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.
6657  
6658  It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the
6659  bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and
6660  with one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody
6661  aft.
6662  
6663  “Sir!” said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on
6664  ship-board except in some extraordinary case.
6665  
6666  “Send everybody aft,” repeated Ahab. “Mast-heads, there! come down!”
6667  
6668  When the entire ship’s company were assembled, and with curious and not
6669  wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike
6670  the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly
6671  glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew,
6672  started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him
6673  resumed his heavy turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched
6674  hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among
6675  the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have
6676  summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat.
6677  But this did not last long. Vehemently pausing, he cried:—
6678  
6679  “What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?”
6680  
6681  “Sing out for him!” was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed
6682  voices.
6683  
6684  “Good!” cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the
6685  hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically
6686  thrown them.
6687  
6688  “And what do ye next, men?”
6689  
6690  “Lower away, and after him!”
6691  
6692  “And what tune is it ye pull to, men?”
6693  
6694  “A dead whale or a stove boat!”
6695  
6696  More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the
6697  countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to
6698  gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they
6699  themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.
6700  
6701  But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his
6702  pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly,
6703  almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:—
6704  
6705  “All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white
6706  whale. Look ye! d’ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?”—holding up a
6707  broad bright coin to the sun—“it is a sixteen dollar piece, men. D’ye
6708  see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.”
6709  
6710  While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was
6711  slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if
6712  to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly
6713  humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and
6714  inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his
6715  vitality in him.
6716  
6717  Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast
6718  with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the
6719  other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: “Whosoever of ye raises
6720  me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw;
6721  whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes
6722  punctured in his starboard fluke—look ye, whosoever of ye raises me
6723  that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!”
6724  
6725  “Huzza! huzza!” cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they
6726  hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.
6727  
6728  “It’s a white whale, I say,” resumed Ahab, as he threw down the
6729  topmaul: “a white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for
6730  white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.”
6731  
6732  All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even
6733  more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of
6734  the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was
6735  separately touched by some specific recollection.
6736  
6737  “Captain Ahab,” said Tashtego, “that white whale must be the same that
6738  some call Moby Dick.”
6739  
6740  “Moby Dick?” shouted Ahab. “Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?”
6741  
6742  “Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?” said the
6743  Gay-Header deliberately.
6744  
6745  “And has he a curious spout, too,” said Daggoo, “very bushy, even for a
6746  parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?”
6747  
6748  “And he have one, two, three—oh! good many iron in him hide, too,
6749  Captain,” cried Queequeg disjointedly, “all twiske-tee be-twisk, like
6750  him—him—” faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and
6751  round as though uncorking a bottle—“like him—him—”
6752  
6753  “Corkscrew!” cried Ahab, “aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted
6754  and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole
6755  shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the
6756  great annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a
6757  split jib in a squall. Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have
6758  seen—Moby Dick—Moby Dick!”
6759  
6760  “Captain Ahab,” said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far
6761  been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed
6762  struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. “Captain
6763  Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick—but it was not Moby Dick that took off
6764  thy leg?”
6765  
6766  “Who told thee that?” cried Ahab; then pausing, “Aye, Starbuck; aye, my
6767  hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that
6768  brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,” he shouted
6769  with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose;
6770  “Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razed me; made a poor
6771  pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!” Then tossing both arms, with
6772  measureless imprecations he shouted out: “Aye, aye! and I’ll chase him
6773  round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom,
6774  and round perdition’s flames before I give him up. And this is what ye
6775  have shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land,
6776  and over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin
6777  out. What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do
6778  look brave.”
6779  
6780  “Aye, aye!” shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the
6781  excited old man: “A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for
6782  Moby Dick!”
6783  
6784  “God bless ye,” he seemed to half sob and half shout. “God bless ye,
6785  men. Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what’s this long
6786  face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not
6787  game for Moby Dick?”
6788  
6789  “I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain
6790  Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I
6791  came here to hunt whales, not my commander’s vengeance. How many
6792  barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain
6793  Ahab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.”
6794  
6795  “Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a
6796  little lower layer. If money’s to be the measurer, man, and the
6797  accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by
6798  girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then,
6799  let me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium _here!_”
6800  
6801  “He smites his chest,” whispered Stubb, “what’s that for? methinks it
6802  rings most vast, but hollow.”
6803  
6804  “Vengeance on a dumb brute!” cried Starbuck, “that simply smote thee
6805  from blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing,
6806  Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous.”
6807  
6808  “Hark ye yet again—the little lower layer. All visible objects, man,
6809  are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event—in the living act, the
6810  undoubted deed—there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth
6811  the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man
6812  will strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach
6813  outside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is
6814  that wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there’s naught beyond.
6815  But ’tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous
6816  strength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable
6817  thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the
6818  white whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me
6819  of blasphemy, man; I’d strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the
6820  sun do that, then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of
6821  fair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my
6822  master, man, is even that fair play. Who’s over me? Truth hath no
6823  confines. Take off thine eye! more intolerable than fiends’ glarings is
6824  a doltish stare! So, so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted
6825  thee to anger-glow. But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that
6826  thing unsays itself. There are men from whom warm words are small
6827  indignity. I meant not to incense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder
6828  Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn—living, breathing pictures painted by
6829  the sun. The Pagan leopards—the unrecking and unworshipping things,
6830  that live; and seek, and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel!
6831  The crew, man, the crew! Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this
6832  matter of the whale? See Stubb! he laughs! See yonder Chilian! he
6833  snorts to think of it. Stand up amid the general hurricane, thy one
6834  tost sapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it? Reckon it. ’Tis but to
6835  help strike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it more? From
6836  this one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all Nantucket, surely
6837  he will not hang back, when every foremast-hand has clutched a
6838  whetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee; I see! the billow lifts thee!
6839  Speak, but speak!—Aye, aye! thy silence, then, _that_ voices thee.
6840  (_Aside_) Something shot from my dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in
6841  his lungs. Starbuck now is mine; cannot oppose me now, without
6842  rebellion.”
6843  
6844  “God keep me!—keep us all!” murmured Starbuck, lowly.
6845  
6846  But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab
6847  did not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the
6848  hold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor
6849  yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment
6850  their hearts sank in. For again Starbuck’s downcast eyes lighted up
6851  with the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the
6852  winds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as
6853  before. Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come?
6854  But rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not so
6855  much predictions from without, as verifications of the foregoing things
6856  within. For with little external to constrain us, the innermost
6857  necessities in our being, these still drive us on.
6858  
6859  “The measure! the measure!” cried Ahab.
6860  
6861  Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he
6862  ordered them to produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him
6863  near the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three
6864  mates stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship’s
6865  company formed a circle round the group; he stood for an instant
6866  searchingly eyeing every man of his crew. But those wild eyes met his,
6867  as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their
6868  leader, ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison; but,
6869  alas! only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.
6870  
6871  “Drink and pass!” he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the
6872  nearest seaman. “The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short
6873  draughts—long swallows, men; ’tis hot as Satan’s hoof. So, so; it goes
6874  round excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the
6875  serpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained. That way it went, this
6876  way it comes. Hand it me—here’s a hollow! Men, ye seem the years; so
6877  brimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!
6878  
6879  “Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all round this capstan; and
6880  ye mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand there
6881  with your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some
6882  sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me. O men,
6883  you will yet see that—Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies come not sooner.
6884  Hand it me. Why, now, this pewter had run brimming again, wer’t not
6885  thou St. Vitus’ imp—away, thou ague!
6886  
6887  “Advance, ye mates! Cross your lances full before me. Well done! Let me
6888  touch the axis.” So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the three
6889  level, radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so doing,
6890  suddenly and nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from
6891  Starbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask. It seemed as though, by some
6892  nameless, interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the
6893  same fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own
6894  magnetic life. The three mates quailed before his strong, sustained,
6895  and mystic aspect. Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him; the honest
6896  eye of Starbuck fell downright.
6897  
6898  “In vain!” cried Ahab; “but, maybe, ’tis well. For did ye three but
6899  once take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, _that_
6900  had perhaps expired from out me. Perchance, too, it would have dropped
6901  ye dead. Perchance ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do
6902  appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there—yon three
6903  most honorable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers. Disdain
6904  the task? What, when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars, using
6905  his tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet cardinals! your own condescension,
6906  _that_ shall bend ye to it. I do not order ye; ye will it. Cut your
6907  seizings and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!”
6908  
6909  Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the
6910  detached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barbs
6911  up, before him.
6912  
6913  “Stab me not with that keen steel! Cant them; cant them over! know ye
6914  not the goblet end? Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye cup-bearers,
6915  advance. The irons! take them; hold them while I fill!” Forthwith,
6916  slowly going from one officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon
6917  sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.
6918  
6919  “Now, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices! Bestow
6920  them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league. Ha!
6921  Starbuck! but the deed is done! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon
6922  it. Drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man the
6923  deathful whaleboat’s bow—Death to Moby Dick! God hunt us all, if we do
6924  not hunt Moby Dick to his death!” The long, barbed steel goblets were
6925  lifted; and to cries and maledictions against the white whale, the
6926  spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss. Starbuck paled,
6927  and turned, and shivered. Once more, and finally, the replenished
6928  pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew; when, waving his free
6929  hand to them, they all dispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin.
6930  
6931  
6932  CHAPTER 37. Sunset.
6933  
6934  _The cabin; by the stern windows; Ahab sitting alone, and gazing out_.
6935  
6936  I leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where’er I
6937  sail. The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them;
6938  but first I pass.
6939  
6940  Yonder, by ever-brimming goblet’s rim, the warm waves blush like wine.
6941  The gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver sun—slow dived from noon—goes
6942  down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. Is, then,
6943  the crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy. Yet is it
6944  bright with many a gem; I the wearer, see not its far flashings; but
6945  darkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds. ’Tis iron—that
6946  I know—not gold. ’Tis split, too—that I feel; the jagged edge galls me
6947  so, my brain seems to beat against the solid metal; aye, steel skull,
6948  mine; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!
6949  
6950  Dry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred
6951  me, so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not
6952  me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne’er enjoy. Gifted
6953  with the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most
6954  subtly and most malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise! Good
6955  night—good night! (_waving his hand, he moves from the window_.)
6956  
6957  ’Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stubborn, at the least;
6958  but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they
6959  revolve. Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they all
6960  stand before me; and I their match. Oh, hard! that to fire others, the
6961  match itself must needs be wasting! What I’ve dared, I’ve willed; and
6962  what I’ve willed, I’ll do! They think me mad—Starbuck does; but I’m
6963  demoniac, I am madness maddened! That wild madness that’s only calm to
6964  comprehend itself! The prophecy was that I should be dismembered;
6965  and—Aye! I lost this leg. I now prophesy that I will dismember my
6966  dismemberer. Now, then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one. That’s
6967  more than ye, ye great gods, ever were. I laugh and hoot at ye, ye
6968  cricket-players, ye pugilists, ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes! I
6969  will not say as schoolboys do to bullies—Take some one of your own
6970  size; don’t pommel _me!_ No, ye’ve knocked me down, and I am up again;
6971  but _ye_ have run and hidden. Come forth from behind your cotton bags!
6972  I have no long gun to reach ye. Come, Ahab’s compliments to ye; come
6973  and see if ye can swerve me. Swerve me? ye cannot swerve me, else ye
6974  swerve yourselves! man has ye there. Swerve me? The path to my fixed
6975  purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run.
6976  Over unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of mountains, under
6977  torrents’ beds, unerringly I rush! Naught’s an obstacle, naught’s an
6978  angle to the iron way!
6979  
6980  
6981  CHAPTER 38. Dusk.
6982  
6983  _By the Mainmast; Starbuck leaning against it_.
6984  
6985  My soul is more than matched; she’s overmanned; and by a madman!
6986  Insufferable sting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field! But
6987  he drilled deep down, and blasted all my reason out of me! I think I
6988  see his impious end; but feel that I must help him to it. Will I, nill
6989  I, the ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with a cable I have
6990  no knife to cut. Horrible old man! Who’s over him, he cries;—aye, he
6991  would be a democrat to all above; look, how he lords it over all below!
6992  Oh! I plainly see my miserable office,—to obey, rebelling; and worse
6993  yet, to hate with touch of pity! For in his eyes I read some lurid woe
6994  would shrivel me up, had I it. Yet is there hope. Time and tide flow
6995  wide. The hated whale has the round watery world to swim in, as the
6996  small gold-fish has its glassy globe. His heaven-insulting purpose, God
6997  may wedge aside. I would up heart, were it not like lead. But my whole
6998  clock’s run down; my heart the all-controlling weight, I have no key to
6999  lift again.
7000  
7001  [_A burst of revelry from the forecastle_.]
7002  
7003  Oh, God! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of
7004  human mothers in them! Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea. The white
7005  whale is their demigorgon. Hark! the infernal orgies! that revelry is
7006  forward! mark the unfaltering silence aft! Methinks it pictures life.
7007  Foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay, embattled,
7008  bantering bow, but only to drag dark Ahab after it, where he broods
7009  within his sternward cabin, builded over the dead water of the wake,
7010  and further on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings. The long howl thrills
7011  me through! Peace! ye revellers, and set the watch! Oh, life! ’tis in
7012  an hour like this, with soul beat down and held to knowledge,—as wild,
7013  untutored things are forced to feed—Oh, life! ’tis now that I do feel
7014  the latent horror in thee! but ’tis not me! that horror’s out of me!
7015  and with the soft feeling of the human in me, yet will I try to fight
7016  ye, ye grim, phantom futures! Stand by me, hold me, bind me, O ye

7024  (_Stubb solus, and mending a brace_.)
7025  
7026  Ha! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!—I’ve been thinking over it ever
7027  since, and that ha, ha’s the final consequence. Why so? Because a
7028  laugh’s the wisest, easiest answer to all that’s queer; and come what
7029  will, one comfort’s always left—that unfailing comfort is, it’s all
7030  predestinated. I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but to my poor
7031  eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt. Be sure
7032  the old Mogul has fixed him, too. I twigged it, knew it; had had the
7033  gift, might readily have prophesied it—for when I clapped my eye upon
7034  his skull I saw it. Well, Stubb, _wise_ Stubb—that’s my title—well,
7035  Stubb, what of it, Stubb? Here’s a carcase. I know not all that may be
7036  coming, but be it what it will, I’ll go to it laughing. Such a waggish
7037  leering as lurks in all your horribles! I feel funny. Fa, la! lirra,
7038  skirra! What’s my juicy little pear at home doing now? Crying its eyes
7039  out?—Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say, gay as
7040  a frigate’s pennant, and so am I—fa, la! lirra, skirra! Oh—
7041  
7042  
7043  We’ll drink to-night with hearts as light, To love, as gay and fleeting
7044  As bubbles that swim, on the beaker’s brim, And break on the lips while
7045  meeting.
7046  
7047  
7048  
7049  A brave stave that—who calls? Mr. Starbuck? Aye, aye, sir—(_Aside_)
7050  he’s my superior, he has his too, if I’m not mistaken.—Aye, aye, sir,
7051  just through with this job—coming.
7052

7054  CHAPTER 40. Midnight, Forecastle.
7055  
7056  HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.
7057  
7058  (_Foresail rises and discovers the watch standing, lounging, leaning,
7059  and lying in various attitudes, all singing in chorus_.)
7060  
7061  
7062    Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies! Farewell and adieu to you,
7063    ladies of Spain! Our captain’s commanded.—
7064  
7065  
7066  
7067  1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR. Oh, boys, don’t be sentimental; it’s bad for the
7068  digestion! Take a tonic, follow me!
7069  
7070  (_Sings, and all follow._)
7071  
7072  
7073   Our captain stood upon the deck, A spy-glass in his hand, A viewing of
7074   those gallant whales That blew at every strand. Oh, your tubs in your
7075   boats, my boys, And by your braces stand, And we’ll have one of those
7076   fine whales, Hand, boys, over hand! So, be cheery, my lads! may your
7077   hearts never fail! While the bold harpooner is striking the whale!
7078  
7079  
7080  
7081  MATE’S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK. Eight bells there, forward!
7082  
7083  2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR. Avast the chorus! Eight bells there! d’ye hear,
7084  bell-boy? Strike the bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me
7085  call the watch. I’ve the sort of mouth for that—the hogshead mouth. So,
7086  so, (_thrusts his head down the scuttle_,) Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y!
7087  Eight bells there below! Tumble up!
7088  
7089  DUTCH SAILOR. Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that. I mark
7090  this in our old Mogul’s wine; it’s quite as deadening to some as
7091  filliping to others. We sing; they sleep—aye, lie down there, like
7092  ground-tier butts. At ’em again! There, take this copper-pump, and hail
7093  ’em through it. Tell ’em to avast dreaming of their lasses. Tell ’em
7094  it’s the resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come to judgment.
7095  That’s the way—_that’s_ it; thy throat ain’t spoiled with eating
7096  Amsterdam butter.
7097  
7098  FRENCH SAILOR. Hist, boys! let’s have a jig or two before we ride to
7099  anchor in Blanket Bay. What say ye? There comes the other watch. Stand
7100  by all legs! Pip! little Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!
7101  
7102  PIP. (_Sulky and sleepy._) Don’t know where it is.
7103  
7104  FRENCH SAILOR. Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears. Jig it, men, I
7105  say; merry’s the word; hurrah! Damn me, won’t you dance? Form, now,
7106  Indian-file, and gallop into the double-shuffle? Throw yourselves!
7107  Legs! legs!
7108  
7109  ICELAND SAILOR. I don’t like your floor, maty; it’s too springy to my
7110  taste. I’m used to ice-floors. I’m sorry to throw cold water on the
7111  subject; but excuse me.
7112  
7113  MALTESE SAILOR. Me too; where’s your girls? Who but a fool would take
7114  his left hand by his right, and say to himself, how d’ye do? Partners!
7115  I must have partners!
7116  
7117  SICILIAN SAILOR. Aye; girls and a green!—then I’ll hop with ye; yea,
7118  turn grasshopper!
7119  
7120  LONG-ISLAND SAILOR. Well, well, ye sulkies, there’s plenty more of us.
7121  Hoe corn when you may, say I. All legs go to harvest soon. Ah! here
7122  comes the music; now for it!
7123  
7124  AZORE SAILOR. (_Ascending, and pitching the tambourine up the
7125  scuttle_.) Here you are, Pip; and there’s the windlass-bitts; up you
7126  mount! Now, boys! (_The half of them dance to the tambourine; some go
7127  below; some sleep or lie among the coils of rigging. Oaths a-plenty_.)
7128  
7129  AZORE SAILOR. (_Dancing_) Go it, Pip! Bang it, bell-boy! Rig it, dig
7130  it, stig it, quig it, bell-boy! Make fire-flies; break the jinglers!
7131  
7132  PIP. Jinglers, you say?—there goes another, dropped off; I pound it so.
7133  
7134  CHINA SAILOR. Rattle thy teeth, then, and pound away; make a pagoda of
7135  thyself.
7136  
7137  FRENCH SAILOR. Merry-mad! Hold up thy hoop, Pip, till I jump through
7138  it! Split jibs! tear yourselves!
7139  
7140  TASHTEGO. (_Quietly smoking._) That’s a white man; he calls that fun:
7141  humph! I save my sweat.
7142  
7143  OLD MANX SAILOR. I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what
7144  they are dancing over. I’ll dance over your grave, I will—that’s the
7145  bitterest threat of your night-women, that beat head-winds round
7146  corners. O Christ! to think of the green navies and the green-skulled
7147  crews! Well, well; belike the whole world’s a ball, as you scholars
7148  have it; and so ’tis right to make one ballroom of it. Dance on, lads,
7149  you’re young; I was once.
7150  
7151  3D NANTUCKET SAILOR. Spell oh!—whew! this is worse than pulling after
7152  whales in a calm—give us a whiff, Tash.
7153  
7154  (_They cease dancing, and gather in clusters. Meantime the sky
7155  darkens—the wind rises_.)
7156  
7157  LASCAR SAILOR. By Brahma! boys, it’ll be douse sail soon. The sky-born,
7158  high-tide Ganges turned to wind! Thou showest thy black brow, Seeva!
7159  
7160  MALTESE SAILOR. (_Reclining and shaking his cap_.) It’s the waves—the
7161  snow’s caps turn to jig it now. They’ll shake their tassels soon. Now
7162  would all the waves were women, then I’d go drown, and chassee with
7163  them evermore! There’s naught so sweet on earth—heaven may not match
7164  it!—as those swift glances of warm, wild bosoms in the dance, when the
7165  over-arboring arms hide such ripe, bursting grapes.
7166  
7167  SICILIAN SAILOR. (_Reclining_.) Tell me not of it! Hark ye, lad—fleet
7168  interlacings of the limbs—lithe swayings—coyings—flutterings! lip!
7169  heart! hip! all graze: unceasing touch and go! not taste, observe ye,
7170  else come satiety. Eh, Pagan? (_Nudging_.)
7171  
7172  TAHITAN SAILOR. (_Reclining on a mat_.) Hail, holy nakedness of our
7173  dancing girls!—the Heeva-Heeva! Ah! low veiled, high palmed Tahiti! I
7174  still rest me on thy mat, but the soft soil has slid! I saw thee woven
7175  in the wood, my mat! green the first day I brought ye thence; now worn
7176  and wilted quite. Ah me!—not thou nor I can bear the change! How then,
7177  if so be transplanted to yon sky? Hear I the roaring streams from
7178  Pirohitee’s peak of spears, when they leap down the crags and drown the
7179  villages?—The blast! the blast! Up, spine, and meet it! (_Leaps to his
7180  feet_.)
7181  
7182  PORTUGUESE SAILOR. How the sea rolls swashing ’gainst the side! Stand
7183  by for reefing, hearties! the winds are just crossing swords, pell-mell
7184  they’ll go lunging presently.
7185  
7186  DANISH SAILOR. Crack, crack, old ship! so long as thou crackest, thou
7187  holdest! Well done! The mate there holds ye to it stiffly. He’s no more
7188  afraid than the isle fort at Cattegat, put there to fight the Baltic
7189  with storm-lashed guns, on which the sea-salt cakes!
7190  
7191  4TH NANTUCKET SAILOR. He has his orders, mind ye that. I heard old Ahab
7192  tell him he must always kill a squall, something as they burst a
7193  waterspout with a pistol—fire your ship right into it!
7194  
7195  ENGLISH SAILOR. Blood! but that old man’s a grand old cove! We are the
7196  lads to hunt him up his whale!
7197  
7198  ALL. Aye! aye!
7199  
7200  OLD MANX SAILOR. How the three pines shake! Pines are the hardest sort
7201  of tree to live when shifted to any other soil, and here there’s none
7202  but the crew’s cursed clay. Steady, helmsman! steady. This is the sort
7203  of weather when brave hearts snap ashore, and keeled hulls split at
7204  sea. Our captain has his birthmark; look yonder, boys, there’s another
7205  in the sky—lurid-like, ye see, all else pitch black.
7206  
7207  DAGGOO. What of that? Who’s afraid of black’s afraid of me! I’m
7208  quarried out of it!
7209  
7210  SPANISH SAILOR. (_Aside_.) He wants to bully, ah!—the old grudge makes
7211  me touchy (_Advancing_.) Aye, harpooneer, thy race is the undeniable
7212  dark side of mankind—devilish dark at that. No offence.
7213  
7214  DAGGOO (_grimly_). None.
7215  
7216  ST. JAGO’S SAILOR. That Spaniard’s mad or drunk. But that can’t be, or
7217  else in his one case our old Mogul’s fire-waters are somewhat long in
7218  working.
7219  
7220  5TH NANTUCKET SAILOR. What’s that I saw—lightning? Yes.
7221  
7222  SPANISH SAILOR. No; Daggoo showing his teeth.
7223  
7224  DAGGOO (_springing_). Swallow thine, mannikin! White skin, white liver!
7225  
7226  SPANISH SAILOR (_meeting him_). Knife thee heartily! big frame, small
7227  spirit!
7228  
7229  ALL. A row! a row! a row!
7230  
7231  TASHTEGO (_with a whiff_). A row a’low, and a row aloft—Gods and
7232  men—both brawlers! Humph!
7233  
7234  BELFAST SAILOR. A row! arrah a row! The Virgin be blessed, a row!
7235  Plunge in with ye!
7236  
7237  ENGLISH SAILOR. Fair play! Snatch the Spaniard’s knife! A ring, a ring!
7238  
7239  OLD MANX SAILOR. Ready formed. There! the ringed horizon. In that ring
7240  Cain struck Abel. Sweet work, right work! No? Why then, God, mad’st
7241  thou the ring?
7242  
7243  MATE’S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK. Hands by the halyards! in
7244  top-gallant sails! Stand by to reef topsails!
7245  
7246  ALL. The squall! the squall! jump, my jollies! (_They scatter_.)
7247  
7248  PIP (_shrinking under the windlass_). Jollies? Lord help such jollies!
7249  Crish, crash! there goes the jib-stay! Blang-whang! God! Duck lower,
7250  Pip, here comes the royal yard! It’s worse than being in the whirled
7251  woods, the last day of the year! Who’d go climbing after chestnuts now?
7252  But there they go, all cursing, and here I don’t. Fine prospects to
7253  ’em; they’re on the road to heaven. Hold on hard! Jimmini, what a
7254  squall! But those chaps there are worse yet—they are your white
7255  squalls, they. White squalls? white whale, shirr! shirr! Here have I
7256  heard all their chat just now, and the white whale—shirr! shirr!—but
7257  spoken of once! and only this evening—it makes me jingle all over like
7258  my tambourine—that anaconda of an old man swore ’em in to hunt him! Oh,
7259  thou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have mercy on
7260  this small black boy down here; preserve him from all men that have no
7261  bowels to feel fear!
7262  
7263  
7264  CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.
7265  
7266  I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest;
7267  my oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and more
7268  did I hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. A
7269  wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab’s quenchless feud
7270  seemed mine. With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous
7271  monster against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of
7272  violence and revenge.
7273  
7274  For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,
7275  secluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly
7276  frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of
7277  his existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen
7278  him; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given
7279  battle to him, was small indeed. For, owing to the large number of
7280  whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire
7281  watery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest
7282  along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth
7283  or more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any
7284  sort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the irregularity
7285  of the times of sailing from home; all these, with other circumstances,
7286  direct and indirect, long obstructed the spread through the whole
7287  world-wide whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings
7288  concerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels
7289  reported to have encountered, at such or such a time, or on such or
7290  such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity,
7291  which whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had
7292  completely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair
7293  presumption, I say, that the whale in question must have been no other
7294  than Moby Dick. Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked
7295  by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and
7296  malice in the monster attacked; therefore it was, that those who by
7297  accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps,
7298  for the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred,
7299  more, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large,
7300  than to the individual cause. In that way, mostly, the disastrous
7301  encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly
7302  regarded.
7303  
7304  And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance
7305  caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one
7306  of them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any
7307  other whale of that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue
7308  in these assaults—not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken
7309  limbs, or devouring amputations—but fatal to the last degree of
7310  fatality; those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and
7311  piling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake
7312  the fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White
7313  Whale had eventually come.
7314  
7315  Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more
7316  horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do
7317  fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising
7318  terrible events,—as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in
7319  maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors
7320  abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to.
7321  And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery
7322  surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and
7323  fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only
7324  are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and
7325  superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they
7326  are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is
7327  appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its
7328  greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such
7329  remotest waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a
7330  thousand shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or
7331  aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and
7332  longitudes, pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is
7333  wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many
7334  a mighty birth.
7335  
7336  No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over
7337  the widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in
7338  the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and
7339  half-formed fœtal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which
7340  eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything
7341  that visibly appears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally
7342  strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White
7343  Whale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his
7344  jaw.
7345  
7346  But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.
7347  Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm
7348  Whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the
7349  leviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are
7350  those this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous
7351  enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would
7352  perhaps—either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or
7353  timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there
7354  are plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not
7355  sailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered
7356  the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is
7357  restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North;
7358  seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish
7359  fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern
7360  whaling. Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale
7361  anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows
7362  which stem him.
7363  
7364  And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary
7365  times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book
7366  naturalists—Olassen and Povelson—declaring the Sperm Whale not only to
7367  be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be
7368  so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood.
7369  Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier’s, were these or almost
7370  similar impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron
7371  himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks
7372  included) are “struck with the most lively terrors,” and “often in the
7373  precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with
7374  such violence as to cause instantaneous death.” And however the general
7375  experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these; yet in
7376  their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the
7377  superstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of their
7378  vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.
7379  
7380  So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few
7381  of the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days
7382  of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long
7383  practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring
7384  warfare; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be
7385  hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition
7386  as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be
7387  inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are
7388  some remarkable documents that may be consulted.
7389  
7390  Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things
7391  were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who,
7392  chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the
7393  specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious
7394  accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if
7395  offered.
7396  
7397  One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked
7398  with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was
7399  the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had
7400  actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same
7401  instant of time.
7402  
7403  Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit
7404  altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability. For as
7405  the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged,
7406  even to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm
7407  Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to
7408  his pursuers; and from time to time have originated the most curious
7409  and contradictory speculations regarding them, especially concerning
7410  the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he
7411  transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant
7412  points.
7413  
7414  It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and
7415  as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby,
7416  that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose
7417  bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland
7418  seas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has
7419  been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could
7420  not have exceeded very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been
7421  believed by some whalemen, that the Nor’ West Passage, so long a
7422  problem to man, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the
7423  real living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old
7424  times of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there
7425  was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the
7426  surface); and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain
7427  near Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy
7428  Land by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost
7429  fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen.
7430  
7431  Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and
7432  knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had
7433  escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen
7434  should go still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not
7435  only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in
7436  time); that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he
7437  would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to
7438  spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for
7439  again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied
7440  jet would once more be seen.
7441  
7442  But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in
7443  the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike
7444  the imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his
7445  uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales,
7446  but, as was elsewhere thrown out—a peculiar snow-white wrinkled
7447  forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent
7448  features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he
7449  revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.
7450  
7451  The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the
7452  same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive
7453  appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by
7454  his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue
7455  sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden
7456  gleamings.
7457  
7458  Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his
7459  deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural
7460  terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to
7461  specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults.
7462  More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than
7463  perhaps aught else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers,
7464  with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known
7465  to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their
7466  boats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship.
7467  
7468  Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar
7469  disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in
7470  the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale’s
7471  infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death
7472  that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an
7473  unintelligent agent.
7474  
7475  Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of
7476  his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed
7477  boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the
7478  white curds of the whale’s direful wrath into the serene, exasperating
7479  sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.
7480  
7481  His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the
7482  eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had
7483  dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly
7484  seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the
7485  whale. That captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping
7486  his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away
7487  Ahab’s leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk,
7488  no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming
7489  malice. Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that
7490  almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness
7491  against the whale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness
7492  he at last came to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but
7493  all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam
7494  before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious
7495  agencies which some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left
7496  living on with half a heart and half a lung. That intangible malignity
7497  which has been from the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern
7498  Christians ascribe one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of
7499  the east reverenced in their statue devil;—Ahab did not fall down and
7500  worship it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the
7501  abhorred white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All
7502  that most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things;
7503  all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the
7504  brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy
7505  Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby
7506  Dick. He piled upon the whale’s white hump the sum of all the general
7507  rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if
7508  his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart’s shell upon it.
7509  
7510  It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at
7511  the precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the
7512  monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,
7513  corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he
7514  probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more.
7515  Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long
7516  months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in
7517  one hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian
7518  Cape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one
7519  another; and so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only then, on
7520  the homeward voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania
7521  seized him, seems all but certain from the fact that, at intervals
7522  during the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a
7523  leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was
7524  moreover intensified by his delirium, that his mates were forced to
7525  lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a
7526  strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when
7527  running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with mild stun’sails
7528  spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances,
7529  the old man’s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn
7530  swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and
7531  air; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale,
7532  and issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the
7533  direful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self,
7534  raved on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.
7535  When you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some
7536  still subtler form. Ahab’s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly
7537  contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows
7538  narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his
7539  narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab’s broad madness had been
7540  left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural
7541  intellect had perished. That before living agent, now became the living
7542  instrument. If such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy
7543  stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its
7544  concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having lost
7545  his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold
7546  more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one
7547  reasonable object.
7548  
7549  This is much; yet Ahab’s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted.
7550  But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding
7551  far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where
7552  we here stand—however grand and wonderful, now quit it;—and take your
7553  way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;
7554  where far beneath the fantastic towers of man’s upper earth, his root
7555  of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique
7556  buried beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken
7557  throne, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he
7558  patient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of
7559  ages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that
7560  proud, sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young
7561  exiled royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old
7562  State-secret come.
7563  
7564  Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means
7565  are sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or
7566  change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long
7567  dissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling
7568  was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate.
7569  Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when
7570  with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him
7571  otherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the
7572  terrible casualty which had overtaken him.
7573  
7574  The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly
7575  ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which
7576  always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the
7577  present voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely,
7578  that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on
7579  account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent
7580  isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons
7581  he was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full
7582  of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and
7583  scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable
7584  idea; such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart
7585  his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes.
7586  Or, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that,
7587  yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on
7588  his underlings to the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is,
7589  that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in
7590  him, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one
7591  only and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had any one
7592  of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking
7593  in him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have
7594  wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on
7595  profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the
7596  mint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural
7597  revenge.
7598  
7599  Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses
7600  a Job’s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made
7601  up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals—morally enfeebled
7602  also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in
7603  Starbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in
7604  Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so
7605  officered, seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality
7606  to help him to his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so
7607  aboundingly responded to the old man’s ire—by what evil magic their
7608  souls were possessed, that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the
7609  White Whale as much their insufferable foe as his; how all this came to
7610  be—what the White Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious
7611  understandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have
7612  seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life,—all this to
7613  explain, would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go. The subterranean
7614  miner that works in us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by
7615  the ever shifting, muffled sound of his pick? Who does not feel the
7616  irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand
7617  still? For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the
7618  place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see
7619  naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.
7620  
7621  
7622  CHAPTER 42. The Whiteness of the Whale.
7623  
7624  What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he
7625  was to me, as yet remains unsaid.
7626  
7627  Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which
7628  could not but occasionally awaken in any man’s soul some alarm, there
7629  was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him,
7630  which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest;
7631  and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost
7632  despair of putting it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of
7633  the whale that above all things appalled me. But how can I hope to
7634  explain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I
7635  must, else all these chapters might be naught.
7636  
7637  Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty,
7638  as if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles,
7639  japonicas, and pearls; and though various nations have in some way
7640  recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric,
7641  grand old kings of Pegu placing the title “Lord of the White Elephants”
7642  above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the
7643  modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the
7644  royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a
7645  snow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire, Cæsarian, heir to
7646  overlording Rome, having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue;
7647  and though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself,
7648  giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe; and
7649  though, besides, all this, whiteness has been even made significant of
7650  gladness, for among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and
7651  though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue is
7652  made the emblem of many touching, noble things—the innocence of brides,
7653  the benignity of age; though among the Red Men of America the giving of
7654  the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor; though in
7655  many climes, whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of
7656  the Judge, and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn
7657  by milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most
7658  august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness
7659  and power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame
7660  being held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies,
7661  Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull; and
7662  though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred
7663  White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology, that
7664  spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send
7665  to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and
7666  though directly from the Latin word for white, all Christian priests
7667  derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic,
7668  worn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish
7669  faith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of
7670  our Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to
7671  the redeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white
7672  before the great white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there
7673  white like wool; yet for all these accumulated associations, with
7674  whatever is sweet, and honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an
7675  elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more
7676  of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood.
7677  
7678  This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when
7679  divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object
7680  terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds.
7681  Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the
7682  tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the
7683  transcendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which
7684  imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific,
7685  to the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged
7686  tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded
7687  bear or shark.*
7688  
7689  *With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who
7690  would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the
7691  whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable
7692  hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness,
7693  it might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that the
7694  irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the
7695  fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together
7696  two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us
7697  with so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this to be true;
7698  yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified
7699  terror.
7700  
7701  As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that
7702  creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the
7703  same quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly
7704  hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish
7705  mass for the dead begins with “Requiem eternam” (eternal rest), whence
7706  _Requiem_ denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral music.
7707  Now, in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark,
7708  and the mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him _Requin_.
7709  
7710  Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual
7711  wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all
7712  imaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God’s great,
7713  unflattering laureate, Nature.*
7714  
7715  *I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged
7716  gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch
7717  below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the
7718  main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and
7719  with a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its
7720  vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous
7721  flutterings and throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered
7722  cries, as some king’s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its
7723  inexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took
7724  hold of God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white
7725  thing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled
7726  waters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of
7727  towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only
7728  hint, the things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and
7729  turning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney!
7730  never had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious
7731  thing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I
7732  learned that goney was some seaman’s name for albatross. So that by no
7733  possibility could Coleridge’s wild Rhyme have had aught to do with
7734  those mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon
7735  our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to
7736  be an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a
7737  little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.
7738  
7739  I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird
7740  chiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in
7741  this, that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey
7742  albatrosses; and these I have frequently seen, but never with such
7743  emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl.
7744  
7745  But how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will
7746  tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea.
7747  At last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern
7748  tally round its neck, with the ship’s time and place; and then letting
7749  it escape. But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was
7750  taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding,
7751  the invoking, and adoring cherubim!
7752  
7753  Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the
7754  White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger,
7755  large-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a
7756  thousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriage. He was the
7757  elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those
7758  days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies. At
7759  their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which
7760  every evening leads on the hosts of light. The flashing cascade of his
7761  mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more
7762  resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. A
7763  most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western
7764  world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the
7765  glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god,
7766  bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether marching amid
7767  his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly
7768  streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether with his
7769  circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White
7770  Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through
7771  his cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to
7772  the bravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe.
7773  Nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this
7774  noble horse, that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so
7775  clothed him with divineness; and that this divineness had that in it
7776  which, though commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain
7777  nameless terror.
7778  
7779  But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that
7780  accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and
7781  Albatross.
7782  
7783  What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks
7784  the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is
7785  that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he
7786  bears. The Albino is as well made as other men—has no substantive
7787  deformity—and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him
7788  more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this be
7789  so?
7790  
7791  Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but not
7792  the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this
7793  crowning attribute of the terrible. From its snowy aspect, the
7794  gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White
7795  Squall. Nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice
7796  omitted so potent an auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the effect of
7797  that passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their
7798  faction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the
7799  market-place!
7800  
7801  Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all
7802  mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It
7803  cannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of
7804  the dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering
7805  there; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of
7806  consternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here. And
7807  from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the
7808  shroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our superstitions do we fail
7809  to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in
7810  a milk-white fog—Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us add, that
7811  even the king of terrors, when personified by the evangelist, rides on
7812  his pallid horse.
7813  
7814  Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious
7815  thing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest
7816  idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.
7817  
7818  But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to
7819  account for it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then, by
7820  the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of
7821  whiteness—though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped
7822  of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful,
7823  but nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same sorcery, however
7824  modified;—can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us
7825  to the hidden cause we seek?
7826  
7827  Let us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety,
7828  and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls. And
7829  though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about
7830  to be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were
7831  entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may not be able
7832  to recall them now.
7833  
7834  Why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely
7835  acquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare
7836  mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary,
7837  speechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded
7838  with new-fallen snow? Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Protestant of
7839  the Middle American States, why does the passing mention of a White
7840  Friar or a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?
7841  
7842  Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and
7843  kings (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White Tower
7844  of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an
7845  untravelled American, than those other storied structures, its
7846  neighbors—the Byward Tower, or even the Bloody? And those sublimer
7847  towers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar
7848  moods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare
7849  mention of that name, while the thought of Virginia’s Blue Ridge is
7850  full of a soft, dewy, distant dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all
7851  latitudes and longitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert such a
7852  spectralness over the fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with
7853  mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves,
7854  followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets? Or, to choose a
7855  wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to the fancy, why, in
7856  reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe, does “the tall pale man”
7857  of the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides
7858  through the green of the groves—why is this phantom more terrible than
7859  all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg?
7860  
7861  Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling
7862  earthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the
7863  tearlessness of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her wide
7864  field of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all adroop
7865  (like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her suburban avenues of
7866  house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack of cards;—it
7867  is not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the strangest,
7868  saddest city thou can’st see. For Lima has taken the white veil; and
7869  there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro,
7870  this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new; admits not the cheerful
7871  greenness of complete decay; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid
7872  pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions.
7873  
7874  I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness
7875  is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of
7876  objects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there
7877  aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind
7878  almost solely consists in this one phenomenon, especially when
7879  exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or
7880  universality. What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be
7881  respectively elucidated by the following examples.
7882  
7883  First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if
7884  by night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels
7885  just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under
7886  precisely similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to
7887  view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness—as if
7888  from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming
7889  round him, then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded
7890  phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in
7891  vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm
7892  they both go down; he never rests till blue water is under him again.
7893  Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee, “Sir, it was not so much
7894  the fear of striking hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous
7895  whiteness that so stirred me?”
7896  
7897  Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the
7898  snow-howdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the
7899  mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast
7900  altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to
7901  lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. Much the same is it with the
7902  backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative indifference views an
7903  unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig
7904  to break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the sailor, beholding
7905  the scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal
7906  trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and
7907  half shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his
7908  misery, views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with
7909  its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses.
7910  
7911  But thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is
7912  but a white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a
7913  hypo, Ishmael.
7914  
7915  Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of
7916  Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey—why is it that upon the
7917  sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that
7918  he cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal muskiness—why
7919  will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the ground in
7920  phrensies of affright? There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of
7921  wild creatures in his green northern home, so that the strange
7922  muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the
7923  experience of former perils; for what knows he, this New England colt,
7924  of the black bisons of distant Oregon?
7925  
7926  No: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the
7927  knowledge of the demonism in the world. Though thousands of miles from
7928  Oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending, goring
7929  bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the
7930  prairies, which this instant they may be trampling into dust.
7931  
7932  Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings of
7933  the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the
7934  windrowed snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking
7935  of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt!
7936  
7937  Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic
7938  sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere
7939  those things must exist. Though in many of its aspects this visible
7940  world seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in
7941  fright.
7942  
7943  But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and
7944  learned why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange
7945  and far more portentous—why, as we have seen, it is at once the most
7946  meaning symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the
7947  Christian’s Deity; and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent
7948  in things the most appalling to mankind.
7949  
7950  Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids
7951  and immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the
7952  thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky
7953  way? Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as
7954  the visible absence of colour; and at the same time the concrete of all
7955  colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness,
7956  full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows—a colourless, all-colour
7957  of atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that other theory
7958  of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues—every stately
7959  or lovely emblazoning—the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea,
7960  and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of
7961  young girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent
7962  in substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified
7963  Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover
7964  nothing but the charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and
7965  consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her
7966  hues, the great principle of light, for ever remains white or colorless
7967  in itself, and if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all
7968  objects, even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge—pondering all
7969  this, the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful
7970  travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring
7971  glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at
7972  the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him. And
7973  of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at
7974  the fiery hunt?
7975  
7976  
7977  CHAPTER 43. Hark!
7978  
7979  “HIST! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”
7980  
7981  It was the middle-watch: a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in
7982  a cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to
7983  the scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the
7984  buckets to fill the scuttle-butt. Standing, for the most part, on the
7985  hallowed precincts of the quarter-deck, they were careful not to speak
7986  or rustle their feet. From hand to hand, the buckets went in the
7987  deepest silence, only broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the
7988  steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.
7989  
7990  It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon,
7991  whose post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a
7992  Cholo, the words above.
7993  
7994  “Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”
7995  
7996  “Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d’ye mean?”
7997  
7998  “There it is again—under the hatches—don’t you hear it—a cough—it
7999  sounded like a cough.”
8000  
8001  “Cough be damned! Pass along that return bucket.”
8002  
8003  “There again—there it is!—it sounds like two or three sleepers turning
8004  over, now!”
8005  
8006  “Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye? It’s the three soaked biscuits
8007  ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye—nothing else. Look to the
8008  bucket!”
8009  
8010  “Say what ye will, shipmate; I’ve sharp ears.”
8011  
8012  “Aye, you are the chap, ain’t ye, that heard the hum of the old
8013  Quakeress’s knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket; you’re
8014  the chap.”
8015  
8016  “Grin away; we’ll see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco, there is somebody
8017  down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck; and I
8018  suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb tell
8019  Flask, one morning watch, that there was something of that sort in the
8020  wind.”
8021  
8022  “Tish! the bucket!”
8023  
8024  
8025  CHAPTER 44. The Chart.
8026  
8027  Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that
8028  took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his
8029  purpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the
8030  transom, and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea
8031  charts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating
8032  himself before it, you would have seen him intently study the various
8033  lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but steady
8034  pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank. At
8035  intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein
8036  were set down the seasons and places in which, on various former
8037  voyages of various ships, sperm whales had been captured or seen.
8038  
8039  While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his
8040  head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever
8041  threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till
8042  it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and
8043  courses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing
8044  lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.
8045  
8046  But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his
8047  cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were
8048  brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and
8049  others were substituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before
8050  him, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to
8051  the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.
8052  
8053  Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans,
8054  it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary
8055  creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it seem
8056  to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby
8057  calculating the driftings of the sperm whale’s food; and, also, calling
8058  to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular
8059  latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to
8060  certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that
8061  ground in search of his prey.
8062  
8063  So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the
8064  sperm whale’s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe
8065  that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;
8066  were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully
8067  collated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to
8068  correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the
8069  flights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have been made to construct
8070  elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*
8071  
8072  
8073    *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by
8074    an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National
8075    Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By that circular, it
8076    appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and
8077    portions of it are presented in the circular. “This chart divides the
8078    ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of
8079    longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve
8080    columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each of which
8081    districts are three lines; one to show the number of days that have
8082    been spent in each month in every district, and the two others to
8083    show the number of days in which whales, sperm or right, have been
8084    seen.”
8085  
8086  
8087  
8088  
8089  Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the
8090  sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct—say, rather, secret
8091  intelligence from the Deity—mostly swim in _veins_, as they are called;
8092  continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating
8093  exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with one
8094  tithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the
8095  direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor’s parallel,
8096  and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own
8097  unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary _vein_ in which at these
8098  times he is said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width
8099  (more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand or contract); but
8100  never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship’s mast-heads, when
8101  circumspectly gliding along this magic zone. The sum is, that at
8102  particular seasons within that breadth and along that path, migrating
8103  whales may with great confidence be looked for.
8104  
8105  And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate
8106  feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing
8107  the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his
8108  art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be
8109  wholly without prospect of a meeting.
8110  
8111  There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his
8112  delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality,
8113  perhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons
8114  for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the
8115  herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year,
8116  say, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were
8117  found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar and
8118  unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true. In
8119  general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the
8120  solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that
8121  though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what
8122  is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on
8123  the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that were the Pequod to
8124  visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she
8125  would infallibly encounter him there. So, too, with some other feeding
8126  grounds, where he had at times revealed himself. But all these seemed
8127  only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not his
8128  places of prolonged abode. And where Ahab’s chances of accomplishing
8129  his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made to
8130  whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a
8131  particular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities
8132  would become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every
8133  possibility the next thing to a certainty. That particular set time and
8134  place were conjoined in the one technical phrase—the
8135  Season-on-the-Line. For there and then, for several consecutive years,
8136  Moby Dick had been periodically descried, lingering in those waters for
8137  awhile, as the sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted
8138  interval in any one sign of the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of
8139  the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the
8140  waves were storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot
8141  where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his
8142  vengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering
8143  vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering
8144  hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one
8145  crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those
8146  hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his
8147  unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.
8148  
8149  Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the
8150  Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her
8151  commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and
8152  then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial
8153  Pacific in time to cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next
8154  ensuing season. Yet the premature hour of the Pequod’s sailing had,
8155  perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very
8156  complexion of things. Because, an interval of three hundred and
8157  sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead
8158  of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt;
8159  if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote
8160  from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow
8161  off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any
8162  other waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons, Pampas,
8163  Nor’-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon,
8164  might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the
8165  Pequod’s circumnavigating wake.
8166  
8167  But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it
8168  not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one
8169  solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of
8170  individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti
8171  in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar
8172  snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be
8173  unmistakable. And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter to
8174  himself, as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he
8175  would throw himself back in reveries—tallied him, and shall he escape?
8176  His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep’s ear!
8177  And here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race; till a
8178  weariness and faintness of pondering came over him; and in the open air
8179  of the deck he would seek to recover his strength. Ah, God! what
8180  trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one
8181  unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes
8182  with his own bloody nails in his palms.
8183  
8184  Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid
8185  dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through
8186  the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them
8187  round and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing
8188  of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was
8189  sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up
8190  from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked
8191  flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap
8192  down among them; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild
8193  cry would be heard through the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would
8194  burst from his state room, as though escaping from a bed that was on
8195  fire. Yet these, perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms
8196  of some latent weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the
8197  plainest tokens of its intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the
8198  scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale; this Ahab
8199  that had gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to
8200  burst from it in horror again. The latter was the eternal, living
8201  principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated
8202  from the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for its
8203  outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the
8204  scorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it
8205  was no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless
8206  leagued with the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab’s
8207  case, yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme
8208  purpose; that purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced
8209  itself against gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent
8210  being of its own. Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common
8211  vitality to which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the
8212  unbidden and unfathered birth. Therefore, the tormented spirit that
8213  glared out of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room,
8214  was for the time but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being,
8215  a ray of living light, to be sure, but without an object to colour, and
8216  therefore a blankness in itself. God help thee, old man, thy thoughts
8217  have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense thinking thus
8218  makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever; that
8219  vulture the very creature he creates.
8220  
8221  
8222  CHAPTER 45. The Affidavit.
8223  
8224  So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed,
8225  as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious
8226  particulars in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in
8227  its earlier part, is as important a one as will be found in this
8228  volume; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and
8229  more familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood,
8230  and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of
8231  the entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural verity
8232  of the main points of this affair.
8233  
8234  I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be
8235  content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of
8236  items, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from
8237  these citations, I take it—the conclusion aimed at will naturally
8238  follow of itself.
8239  
8240  First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after
8241  receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an
8242  interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by the
8243  same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same
8244  private cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where
8245  three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I
8246  think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted
8247  them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to
8248  Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far
8249  into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years,
8250  often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with
8251  all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of
8252  unknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been
8253  on its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe,
8254  brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose.
8255  This man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the
8256  other. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this;
8257  that is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second
8258  attack, saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them,
8259  afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so
8260  fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the
8261  last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the
8262  whale’s eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say
8263  three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are three
8264  instances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard
8265  of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there
8266  is no good ground to impeach.
8267  
8268  Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant
8269  the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable
8270  historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at
8271  distant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became
8272  thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily
8273  peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar
8274  in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his
8275  peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly
8276  valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences
8277  of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about
8278  such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most
8279  fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their
8280  tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea,
8281  without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some
8282  poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man, they
8283  make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street, lest if they
8284  pursued the acquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump
8285  for their presumption.
8286  
8287  But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual
8288  celebrity—Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he
8289  famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death,
8290  but he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions
8291  of a name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Cæsar. Was it not
8292  so, O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so
8293  long did’st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose spout was
8294  oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it not so, O New Zealand
8295  Jack! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the
8296  vicinity of the Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O Morquan! King of Japan,
8297  whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white
8298  cross against the sky? Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale,
8299  marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In
8300  plain prose, here are four whales as well known to the students of
8301  Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar.
8302  
8303  But this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various
8304  times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were
8305  finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed
8306  by valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their anchors with that
8307  express object as much in view, as in setting out through the
8308  Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture
8309  that notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost warrior of the
8310  Indian King Philip.
8311  
8312  I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make
8313  mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in
8314  printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the
8315  whole story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For
8316  this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full
8317  as much bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of
8318  the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that without some
8319  hints touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the
8320  fishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still
8321  worse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.
8322  
8323  First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general
8324  perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid
8325  conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur.
8326  One reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters
8327  and deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record at
8328  home, however transient and immediately forgotten that record. Do you
8329  suppose that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by
8330  the whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to
8331  the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan—do you suppose that
8332  that poor fellow’s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will
8333  read to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very
8334  irregular between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what
8335  might be called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I
8336  tell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific,
8337  among many others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which
8338  had had a death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that
8339  had each lost a boat’s crew. For God’s sake, be economical with your
8340  lamps and candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of
8341  man’s blood was spilled for it.
8342  
8343  Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale
8344  is an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that
8345  when narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold
8346  enormousness, they have significantly complimented me upon my
8347  facetiousness; when, I declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of
8348  being facetious than Moses, when he wrote the history of the plagues of
8349  Egypt.
8350  
8351  But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon
8352  testimony entirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm
8353  Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously
8354  malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy,
8355  and sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale _has_ done it.
8356  
8357  First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket,
8358  was cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her
8359  boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of
8360  the whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping
8361  from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the
8362  ship. Dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that
8363  in less than “ten minutes” she settled down and fell over. Not a
8364  surviving plank of her has been seen since. After the severest
8365  exposure, part of the crew reached the land in their boats. Being
8366  returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific
8367  in command of another ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon
8368  unknown rocks and breakers; for the second time his ship was utterly
8369  lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never tempted it since.
8370  At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket. I have seen
8371  Owen Chace, who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy;
8372  I have read his plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed with his
8373  son; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe.*
8374  
8375  *The following are extracts from Chace’s narrative: “Every fact seemed
8376  to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which
8377  directed his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at
8378  a short interval between them, both of which, according to their
8379  direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made
8380  ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the
8381  shock; to effect which, the exact manœuvres which he made were
8382  necessary. His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated
8383  resentment and fury. He came directly from the shoal which we had just
8384  before entered, and in which we had struck three of his companions, as
8385  if fired with revenge for their sufferings.” Again: “At all events, the
8386  whole circumstances taken together, all happening before my own eyes,
8387  and producing, at the time, impressions in my mind of decided,
8388  calculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many of which
8389  impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that I am
8390  correct in my opinion.”
8391  
8392  Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a
8393  black night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any
8394  hospitable shore. “The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the
8395  fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon
8396  hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful
8397  contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment’s thought; the
8398  dismal looking wreck, and _the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale_,
8399  wholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its appearance.”
8400  
8401  In another place—p. 45,—he speaks of “_the mysterious and mortal attack
8402  of the animal_.”
8403  
8404  Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807
8405  totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic
8406  particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter,
8407  though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual
8408  allusions to it.
8409  
8410  Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J——, then
8411  commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be
8412  dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in
8413  the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales,
8414  the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength
8415  ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily
8416  denied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout
8417  sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very
8418  good; but there is more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set
8419  sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on
8420  the way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments’
8421  confidential business with him. That business consisted in fetching the
8422  Commodore’s craft such a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made
8423  straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair. I am not
8424  superstitious, but I consider the Commodore’s interview with that whale
8425  as providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a
8426  similar fright? I tell you, the sperm whale will stand no nonsense.
8427  
8428  I will now refer you to Langsdorff’s Voyages for a little circumstance
8429  in point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorff, you
8430  must know by the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern’s
8431  famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century.
8432  Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter:
8433  
8434  “By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day
8435  we were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was
8436  very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to
8437  keep on our fur clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was
8438  not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up.
8439  An uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship
8440  itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was not perceived
8441  by any one on board till the moment when the ship, which was in full
8442  sail, was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its
8443  striking against him. We were thus placed in the most imminent danger,
8444  as this gigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three
8445  feet at least out of the water. The masts reeled, and the sails fell
8446  altogether, while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck,
8447  concluding that we had struck upon some rock; instead of this we saw
8448  the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity. Captain
8449  D’Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the
8450  vessel had received any damage from the shock, but we found that very
8451  happily it had escaped entirely uninjured.”
8452  
8453  Now, the Captain D’Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in
8454  question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual
8455  adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of
8456  Dorchester near Boston. I have the honor of being a nephew of his. I
8457  have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff.
8458  He substantiates every word. The ship, however, was by no means a large
8459  one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my
8460  uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.
8461  
8462  In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full,
8463  too, of honest wonders—the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient
8464  Dampier’s old chums—I found a little matter set down so like that just
8465  quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a
8466  corroborative example, if such be needed.
8467  
8468  Lionel, it seems, was on his way to “John Ferdinando,” as he calls the
8469  modern Juan Fernandes. “In our way thither,” he says, “about four
8470  o’clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty
8471  leagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which
8472  put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where
8473  they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for death.
8474  And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for
8475  granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the amazement was
8476  a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground. * *
8477  * * * The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their
8478  carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks.
8479  Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown out of his
8480  cabin!” Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake, and
8481  seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great
8482  earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great mischief
8483  along the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the
8484  darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all
8485  caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.
8486  
8487  I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to
8488  me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more
8489  than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing
8490  boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long
8491  withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship
8492  Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let
8493  me say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a
8494  running sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and
8495  secured there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a
8496  horse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if
8497  the sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts,
8498  not so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of
8499  destruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent
8500  indication of his character, that upon being attacked he will
8501  frequently open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for
8502  several consecutive minutes. But I must be content with only one more
8503  and a concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one,
8504  by which you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous
8505  event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but
8506  that these marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages;
8507  so that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon—Verily there is
8508  nothing new under the sun.
8509  
8510  In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate
8511  of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and
8512  Belisarius general. As many know, he wrote the history of his own
8513  times, a work every way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he
8514  has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating
8515  historian, except in some one or two particulars, not at all affecting
8516  the matter presently to be mentioned.
8517  
8518  Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term
8519  of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured
8520  in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed
8521  vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty
8522  years. A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be
8523  gainsaid. Nor is there any reason it should be. Of what precise species
8524  this sea-monster was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as
8525  well as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly
8526  inclined to think a sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long
8527  time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the
8528  Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even now I am
8529  certain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the
8530  present constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious
8531  resort. But further investigations have recently proved to me, that in
8532  modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the
8533  sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that on
8534  the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the
8535  skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of war readily passes
8536  through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route,
8537  pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.
8538  
8539  In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar
8540  substance called _brit_ is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.
8541  But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm
8542  whale—squid or cuttle-fish—lurks at the bottom of that sea, because
8543  large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been
8544  found at its surface. If, then, you properly put these statements
8545  together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,
8546  according to all human reasoning, Procopius’s sea-monster, that for
8547  half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all
8548  probability have been a sperm whale.
8549  
8550  
8551  CHAPTER 46. Surmises.
8552  
8553  Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his
8554  thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby
8555  Dick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that
8556  one passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and
8557  long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman’s ways, altogether
8558  to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if
8559  this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more
8560  influential with him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even
8561  considering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the
8562  White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all
8563  sperm whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he
8564  multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would
8565  prove to be the hated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be
8566  indeed exceptionable, there were still additional considerations which,
8567  though not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling
8568  passion, yet were by no means incapable of swaying him.
8569  
8570  To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in
8571  the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew,
8572  for example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was
8573  over Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual
8574  man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual
8575  mastership; for to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in
8576  a sort of corporeal relation. Starbuck’s body and Starbuck’s coerced
8577  will were Ahab’s, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck’s brain;
8578  still he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred
8579  his captain’s quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate himself
8580  from it, or even frustrate it. It might be that a long interval would
8581  elapse ere the White Whale was seen. During that long interval Starbuck
8582  would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his
8583  captain’s leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial
8584  influences were brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle
8585  insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly
8586  manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing
8587  that, for the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that
8588  strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the
8589  full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure
8590  background (for few men’s courage is proof against protracted
8591  meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long night
8592  watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of
8593  than Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had
8594  hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are
8595  more or less capricious and unreliable—they live in the varying outer
8596  weather, and they inhale its fickleness—and when retained for any
8597  object remote and blank in the pursuit, however promissory of life and
8598  passion in the end, it is above all things requisite that temporary
8599  interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily
8600  suspended for the final dash.
8601  
8602  Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion
8603  mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.
8604  The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought
8605  Ahab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the
8606  hearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even
8607  breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for
8608  the love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food
8609  for their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and
8610  chivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two
8611  thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without
8612  committing burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious
8613  perquisites by the way. Had they been strictly held to their one final
8614  and romantic object—that final and romantic object, too many would have
8615  turned from in disgust. I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of
8616  all hopes of cash—aye, cash. They may scorn cash now; but let some
8617  months go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this
8618  same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would
8619  soon cashier Ahab.
8620  
8621  Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related
8622  to Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps
8623  somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the
8624  Pequod’s voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he
8625  had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of
8626  usurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew
8627  if so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further
8628  obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command. From
8629  even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible
8630  consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must
8631  of course have been most anxious to protect himself. That protection
8632  could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand,
8633  backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute
8634  atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be
8635  subjected to.
8636  
8637  For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be
8638  verbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good
8639  degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod’s
8640  voyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force
8641  himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general
8642  pursuit of his profession.
8643  
8644  Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three
8645  mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit
8646  reporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward.
8647  
8648  
8649  CHAPTER 47. The Mat-Maker.
8650  
8651  It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging
8652  about the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters.
8653  Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat,
8654  for an additional lashing to our boat. So still and subdued and yet
8655  somehow preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of reverie
8656  lurked in the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own
8657  invisible self.
8658  
8659  I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I
8660  kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the
8661  long yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as
8662  Queequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword
8663  between the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly
8664  and unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess
8665  did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea, only
8666  broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as
8667  if this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle mechanically
8668  weaving and weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed threads of
8669  the warp subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging
8670  vibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise
8671  interblending of other threads with its own. This warp seemed
8672  necessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own shuttle
8673  and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads. Meantime,
8674  Queequeg’s impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof
8675  slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be;
8676  and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding
8677  contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this savage’s
8678  sword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and
8679  woof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance—aye, chance, free
8680  will, and necessity—nowise incompatible—all interweavingly working
8681  together. The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its
8682  ultimate course—its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending
8683  to that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads;
8684  and chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of
8685  necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though
8686  thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the
8687  last featuring blow at events.
8688  
8689  Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so
8690  strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of
8691  free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds
8692  whence that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees
8693  was that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly
8694  forward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden
8695  intervals he continued his cries. To be sure the same sound was that
8696  very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of
8697  whalemen’s look-outs perched as high in the air; but from few of those
8698  lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous
8699  cadence as from Tashtego the Indian’s.
8700  
8701  As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and
8702  eagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some
8703  prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries
8704  announcing their coming.
8705  
8706  “There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!”
8707  
8708  “Where-away?”
8709  
8710  “On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!”
8711  
8712  Instantly all was commotion.
8713  
8714  The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and
8715  reliable uniformity. And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from
8716  other tribes of his genus.
8717  
8718  “There go flukes!” was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales
8719  disappeared.
8720  
8721  “Quick, steward!” cried Ahab. “Time! time!”
8722  
8723  Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact
8724  minute to Ahab.
8725  
8726  The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling
8727  before it. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to
8728  leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of
8729  our bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale
8730  when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while
8731  concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in
8732  the opposite quarter—this deceitfulness of his could not now be in
8733  action; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by
8734  Tashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our
8735  vicinity. One of the men selected for shipkeepers—that is, those not
8736  appointed to the boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the
8737  main-mast head. The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the
8738  line tubs were fixed in their places; the cranes were thrust out; the
8739  mainyard was backed, and the three boats swung over the sea like three
8740  samphire baskets over high cliffs. Outside of the bulwarks their eager
8741  crews with one hand clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly
8742  poised on the gunwale. So look the long line of man-of-war’s men about
8743  to throw themselves on board an enemy’s ship.
8744  
8745  But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took
8746  every eye from the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was
8747  surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.
8748  
8749  
8750  CHAPTER 48. The First Lowering.
8751  
8752  The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side
8753  of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the
8754  tackles and bands of the boat which swung there. This boat had always
8755  been deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called the
8756  captain’s, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter. The
8757  figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white
8758  tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese
8759  jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black
8760  trowsers of the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness
8761  was a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and
8762  coiled round and round upon his head. Less swart in aspect, the
8763  companions of this figure were of that vivid, tiger-yellow complexion
8764  peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas;—a race
8765  notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some honest white
8766  mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents
8767  on the water of the devil, their lord, whose counting-room they suppose
8768  to be elsewhere.
8769  
8770  While yet the wondering ship’s company were gazing upon these
8771  strangers, Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head,
8772  “All ready there, Fedallah?”
8773  
8774  “Ready,” was the half-hissed reply.
8775  
8776  “Lower away then; d’ye hear?” shouting across the deck. “Lower away
8777  there, I say.”
8778  
8779  Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the
8780  men sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with
8781  a wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a
8782  dexterous, off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the
8783  sailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship’s side into the tossed
8784  boats below.
8785  
8786  Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship’s lee, when a fourth
8787  keel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and
8788  showed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the
8789  stern, loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves
8790  widely, so as to cover a large expanse of water. But with all their
8791  eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates of
8792  the other boats obeyed not the command.
8793  
8794  “Captain Ahab?—” said Starbuck.
8795  
8796  “Spread yourselves,” cried Ahab; “give way, all four boats. Thou,
8797  Flask, pull out more to leeward!”
8798  
8799  “Aye, aye, sir,” cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his
8800  great steering oar. “Lay back!” addressing his crew.
8801  “There!—there!—there again! There she blows right ahead, boys!—lay
8802  back!”
8803  
8804  “Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.”
8805  
8806  “Oh, I don’t mind ’em, sir,” said Archy; “I knew it all before now.
8807  Didn’t I hear ’em in the hold? And didn’t I tell Cabaco here of it?
8808  What say ye, Cabaco? They are stowaways, Mr. Flask.”
8809  
8810  “Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little
8811  ones,” drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of whom
8812  still showed signs of uneasiness. “Why don’t you break your backbones,
8813  my boys? What is it you stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat? Tut! They
8814  are only five more hands come to help us—never mind from where—the more
8815  the merrier. Pull, then, do pull; never mind the brimstone—devils are
8816  good fellows enough. So, so; there you are now; that’s the stroke for a
8817  thousand pounds; that’s the stroke to sweep the stakes! Hurrah for the
8818  gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! Three cheers, men—all hearts alive!
8819  Easy, easy; don’t be in a hurry—don’t be in a hurry. Why don’t you snap
8820  your oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so, so,
8821  then:—softly, softly! That’s it—that’s it! long and strong. Give way
8822  there, give way! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are
8823  all asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull. Pull, will ye? pull,
8824  can’t ye? pull, won’t ye? Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes
8825  don’t ye pull?—pull and break something! pull, and start your eyes out!
8826  Here!” whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle; “every mother’s
8827  son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the blade between his teeth.
8828  That’s it—that’s it. Now ye do something; that looks like it, my
8829  steel-bits. Start her—start her, my silver-spoons! Start her,
8830  marling-spikes!”
8831  
8832  Stubb’s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had
8833  rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in
8834  inculcating the religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this
8835  specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions
8836  with his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief
8837  peculiarity. He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a
8838  tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so
8839  calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear
8840  such queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling
8841  for the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy
8842  and indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so
8843  broadly gaped—open-mouthed at times—that the mere sight of such a
8844  yawning commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon
8845  the crew. Then again, Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists,
8846  whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all
8847  inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them.
8848  
8849  In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely
8850  across Stubb’s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were
8851  pretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.
8852  
8853  “Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye
8854  please!”
8855  
8856  “Halloa!” returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he
8857  spoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set
8858  like a flint from Stubb’s.
8859  
8860  “What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!”
8861  
8862  “Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,
8863  boys!)” in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: “A sad
8864  business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never mind,
8865  Mr. Stubb, all for the best. Let all your crew pull strong, come what
8866  will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There’s hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr.
8867  Stubb, and that’s what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm, sperm’s the
8868  play! This at least is duty; duty and profit hand in hand.”
8869  
8870  “Aye, aye, I thought as much,” soliloquized Stubb, when the boats
8871  diverged, “as soon as I clapt eye on ’em, I thought so. Aye, and that’s
8872  what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long
8873  suspected. They were hidden down there. The White Whale’s at the bottom
8874  of it. Well, well, so be it! Can’t be helped! All right! Give way, men!
8875  It ain’t the White Whale to-day! Give way!”
8876  
8877  Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant
8878  as the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably
8879  awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship’s
8880  company; but Archy’s fancied discovery having some time previous got
8881  abroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some
8882  small measure prepared them for the event. It took off the extreme edge
8883  of their wonder; and so what with all this and Stubb’s confident way of
8884  accounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed from
8885  superstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room
8886  for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab’s precise agency in
8887  the matter from the beginning. For me, I silently recalled the
8888  mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the
8889  dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the enigmatical hintings of the
8890  unaccountable Elijah.
8891  
8892  Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the
8893  furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a
8894  circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger
8895  yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five
8896  trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which
8897  periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst
8898  boiler out of a Mississippi steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen
8899  pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and
8900  displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the
8901  gunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery
8902  horizon; while at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a
8903  fencer’s, thrown half backward into the air, as if to counterbalance
8904  any tendency to trip; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar
8905  as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him. All
8906  at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained
8907  fixed, while the boat’s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked. Boat
8908  and crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly the three spread boats in
8909  the rear paused on their way. The whales had irregularly settled bodily
8910  down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the
8911  movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.
8912  
8913  “Every man look out along his oars!” cried Starbuck. “Thou, Queequeg,
8914  stand up!”
8915  
8916  Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage
8917  stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the
8918  spot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme
8919  stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with
8920  the gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing
8921  himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently
8922  eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.
8923  
8924  Not very far distant Flask’s boat was also lying breathlessly still;
8925  its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a
8926  stout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above
8927  the level of the stern platform. It is used for catching turns with the
8928  whale line. Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man’s hand,
8929  and standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the
8930  mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks. But little
8931  King-Post was small and short, and at the same time little King-Post
8932  was full of a large and tall ambition, so that this loggerhead
8933  stand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.
8934  
8935  “I can’t see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to
8936  that.”
8937  
8938  Upon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way,
8939  swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty
8940  shoulders for a pedestal.
8941  
8942  “Good a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?”
8943  
8944  “That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you
8945  fifty feet taller.”
8946  
8947  Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the
8948  boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to
8949  Flask’s foot, and then putting Flask’s hand on his hearse-plumed head
8950  and bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one dexterous
8951  fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders. And here was
8952  Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a
8953  breastband to lean against and steady himself by.
8954  
8955  At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous
8956  habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect
8957  posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously
8958  perverse and cross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily
8959  perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the
8960  sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more
8961  curious; for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy,
8962  unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the
8963  sea harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired
8964  Flask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider.
8965  Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now
8966  and then stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby
8967  give to the negro’s lordly chest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity
8968  stamping the living magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her
8969  tides and her seasons for that.
8970  
8971  Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing
8972  solicitudes. The whales might have made one of their regular soundings,
8973  not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were the case,
8974  Stubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the
8975  languishing interval with his pipe. He withdrew it from his hatband,
8976  where he always wore it aslant like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed
8977  home the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his
8978  match across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when Tashtego, his
8979  harpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed
8980  stars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat,
8981  crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, “Down, down all, and give
8982  way!—there they are!”
8983  
8984  To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been
8985  visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white
8986  water, and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it, and
8987  suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white
8988  rolling billows. The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it
8989  were, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this
8990  atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of
8991  water, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other
8992  indications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed their forerunning
8993  couriers and detached flying outriders.
8994  
8995  All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled
8996  water and air. But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on, as
8997  a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the
8998  hills.
8999  
9000  “Pull, pull, my good boys,” said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but
9001  intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance
9002  from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two
9003  visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much
9004  to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the
9005  silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his
9006  peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.
9007  
9008  How different the loud little King-Post. “Sing out and say something,
9009  my hearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on
9010  their black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I’ll sign over to you
9011  my Martha’s Vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children,
9012  boys. Lay me on—lay me on! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring
9013  mad! See! see that white water!” And so shouting, he pulled his hat
9014  from his head, and stamped up and down on it; then picking it up,
9015  flirted it far off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and
9016  plunging in the boat’s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.
9017  
9018  “Look at that chap now,” philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his
9019  unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a
9020  short distance, followed after—“He’s got fits, that Flask has. Fits?
9021  yes, give him fits—that’s the very word—pitch fits into ’em. Merrily,
9022  merrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for supper, you know;—merry’s the word.
9023  Pull, babes—pull, sucklings—pull, all. But what the devil are you
9024  hurrying about? Softly, softly, and steadily, my men. Only pull, and
9025  keep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your backbones, and bite your
9026  knives in two—that’s all. Take it easy—why don’t ye take it easy, I
9027  say, and burst all your livers and lungs!”
9028  
9029  But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of
9030  his—these were words best omitted here; for you live under the blessed
9031  light of the evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in the audacious
9032  seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of
9033  red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.
9034  
9035  Meanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of
9036  Flask to “that whale,” as he called the fictitious monster which he
9037  declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat’s bow with its
9038  tail—these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that
9039  they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look
9040  over the shoulder. But this was against all rule; for the oarsmen must
9041  put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks; usage
9042  pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but
9043  arms, in these critical moments.
9044  
9045  It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the
9046  omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled
9047  along the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless
9048  bowling-green; the brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip
9049  for an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that almost
9050  seemed threatening to cut it in two; the sudden profound dip into the
9051  watery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the
9052  top of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its other
9053  side;—all these, with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and
9054  the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the
9055  ivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails, like
9056  a wild hen after her screaming brood;—all this was thrilling.
9057  
9058  Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever
9059  heat of his first battle; not the dead man’s ghost encountering the
9060  first unknown phantom in the other world;—neither of these can feel
9061  stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first
9062  time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the
9063  hunted sperm whale.
9064  
9065  The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and
9066  more visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows
9067  flung upon the sea. The jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted
9068  everywhere to right and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes.
9069  The boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales
9070  running dead to leeward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still
9071  rising wind, we rushed along; the boat going with such madness through
9072  the water, that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to
9073  escape being torn from the row-locks.
9074  
9075  Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither
9076  ship nor boat to be seen.
9077  
9078  “Give way, men,” whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the
9079  sheet of his sail; “there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall
9080  comes. There’s white water again!—close to! Spring!”
9081  
9082  Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted
9083  that the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when
9084  with a lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: “Stand up!” and
9085  Queequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.
9086  
9087  Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril
9088  so close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance
9089  of the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent
9090  instant had come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of
9091  fifty elephants stirring in their litter. Meanwhile the boat was still
9092  booming through the mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like
9093  the erected crests of enraged serpents.
9094  
9095  “That’s his hump. _There_, _there_, give it to him!” whispered
9096  Starbuck.
9097  
9098  A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of
9099  Queequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from
9100  astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail
9101  collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by;
9102  something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole
9103  crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the
9104  white curdling cream of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all
9105  blended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.
9106  
9107  Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round
9108  it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale,
9109  tumbled back to our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea,
9110  the water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing
9111  eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the
9112  bottom of the ocean.
9113  
9114  The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together;
9115  the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white
9116  fire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning; immortal
9117  in these jaws of death! In vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar
9118  to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those
9119  boats in that storm. Meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew
9120  darker with the shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen.
9121  The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. The oars were
9122  useless as propellers, performing now the office of life-preservers.
9123  So, cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many
9124  failures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then
9125  stretching it on a waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the
9126  standard-bearer of this forlorn hope. There, then, he sat, holding up
9127  that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness. There,
9128  then, he sat, the sign and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly
9129  holding up hope in the midst of despair.
9130  
9131  Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat,
9132  we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still spread over
9133  the sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat.
9134  Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear.
9135  We all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled
9136  by the storm. The sound came nearer and nearer; the thick mists were
9137  dimly parted by a huge, vague form. Affrighted, we all sprang into the
9138  sea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down upon us
9139  within a distance of not much more than its length.
9140  
9141  Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it
9142  tossed and gaped beneath the ship’s bows like a chip at the base of a
9143  cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no
9144  more till it came up weltering astern. Again we swam for it, were
9145  dashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely
9146  landed on board. Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut
9147  loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time. The ship
9148  had given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon
9149  some token of our perishing,—an oar or a lance pole.
9150  
9151  
9152  CHAPTER 49. The Hyena.
9153  
9154  There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed
9155  affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast
9156  practical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more
9157  than suspects that the joke is at nobody’s expense but his own.
9158  However, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing. He
9159  bolts down all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions, all
9160  hard things visible and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an ostrich
9161  of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for
9162  small difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril
9163  of life and limb; all these, and death itself, seem to him only sly,
9164  good-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen
9165  and unaccountable old joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am
9166  speaking of, comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation;
9167  it comes in the very midst of his earnestness, so that what just before
9168  might have seemed to him a thing most momentous, now seems but a part
9169  of the general joke. There is nothing like the perils of whaling to
9170  breed this free and easy sort of genial, desperado philosophy; and with
9171  it I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White
9172  Whale its object.
9173  
9174  “Queequeg,” said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the
9175  deck, and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the
9176  water; “Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often
9177  happen?” Without much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he
9178  gave me to understand that such things did often happen.
9179  
9180  “Mr. Stubb,” said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his
9181  oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; “Mr. Stubb, I
9182  think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief
9183  mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I suppose
9184  then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy
9185  squall is the height of a whaleman’s discretion?”
9186  
9187  “Certain. I’ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off
9188  Cape Horn.”
9189  
9190  “Mr. Flask,” said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing
9191  close by; “you are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will you
9192  tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask,
9193  for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into
9194  death’s jaws?”
9195  
9196  “Can’t you twist that smaller?” said Flask. “Yes, that’s the law. I
9197  should like to see a boat’s crew backing water up to a whale face
9198  foremost. Ha, ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind
9199  that!”
9200  
9201  Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement
9202  of the entire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings
9203  in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of
9204  common occurrence in this kind of life; considering that at the
9205  superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign
9206  my life into the hands of him who steered the boat—oftentimes a fellow
9207  who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of
9208  scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings; considering that
9209  the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be
9210  imputed to Starbuck’s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a
9211  squall, and considering that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for
9212  his great heedfulness in the fishery; considering that I belonged to
9213  this uncommonly prudent Starbuck’s boat; and finally considering in
9214  what a devil’s chase I was implicated, touching the White Whale: taking
9215  all things together, I say, I thought I might as well go below and make
9216  a rough draft of my will. “Queequeg,” said I, “come along, you shall be
9217  my lawyer, executor, and legatee.”
9218  
9219  It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at
9220  their last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world
9221  more fond of that diversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical
9222  life that I had done the same thing. After the ceremony was concluded
9223  upon the present occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone was rolled
9224  away from my heart. Besides, all the days I should now live would be as
9225  good as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a
9226  supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might
9227  be. I survived myself; my death and burial were locked up in my chest.
9228  I looked round me tranquilly and contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a
9229  clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault.
9230  
9231  Now then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock,
9232  here goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction, and the
9233  devil fetch the hindmost.
9234  
9235  
9236  CHAPTER 50. Ahab’s Boat and Crew. Fedallah.
9237  
9238  “Who would have thought it, Flask!” cried Stubb; “if I had but one leg
9239  you would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the plug-hole
9240  with my timber toe. Oh! he’s a wonderful old man!”
9241  
9242  “I don’t think it so strange, after all, on that account,” said Flask.
9243  “If his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different thing.
9244  That would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of the other
9245  left, you know.”
9246  
9247  “I don’t know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel.”
9248  
9249  Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering
9250  the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it
9251  is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active
9252  perils of the chase. So Tamerlane’s soldiers often argued with tears in
9253  their eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried
9254  into the thickest of the fight.
9255  
9256  But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering that
9257  with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger;
9258  considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and
9259  extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then
9260  comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed
9261  man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the
9262  joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not.
9263  
9264  Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of
9265  his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of
9266  the chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving
9267  his orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually
9268  apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt—above all for
9269  Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat’s
9270  crew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads
9271  of the owners of the Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a boat’s
9272  crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head.
9273  Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that
9274  matter. Until Cabaco’s published discovery, the sailors had little
9275  foreseen it, though to be sure when, after being a little while out of
9276  port, all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the
9277  whaleboats for service; when some time after this Ahab was now and then
9278  found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his
9279  own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even
9280  solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which when the line is
9281  running out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when all this was
9282  observed in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an extra
9283  coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better
9284  withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety
9285  he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it
9286  is sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat’s bow for bracing
9287  the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was
9288  observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee
9289  fixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the
9290  carpenter’s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a
9291  little there; all these things, I say, had awakened much interest and
9292  curiosity at the time. But almost everybody supposed that this
9293  particular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to
9294  the ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had already revealed his
9295  intention to hunt that mortal monster in person. But such a supposition
9296  did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat’s crew
9297  being assigned to that boat.
9298  
9299  Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned
9300  away; for in a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such
9301  unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown
9302  nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of
9303  whalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway
9304  creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck,
9305  oars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that
9306  Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin
9307  to chat with the captain, and it would not create any unsubduable
9308  excitement in the forecastle.
9309  
9310  But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate
9311  phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were
9312  somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a
9313  muffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly world like
9314  this, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be
9315  linked with Ahab’s peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort
9316  of a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have been even
9317  authority over him; all this none knew. But one cannot sustain an
9318  indifferent air concerning Fedallah. He was such a creature as
9319  civilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their
9320  dreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and then glide
9321  among the unchanging Asiatic communities, especially the Oriental isles
9322  to the east of the continent—those insulated, immemorial, unalterable
9323  countries, which even in these modern days still preserve much of the
9324  ghostly aboriginalness of earth’s primal generations, when the memory
9325  of the first man was a distinct recollection, and all men his
9326  descendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as real
9327  phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and
9328  to what end; when though, according to Genesis, the angels indeed
9329  consorted with the daughters of men, the devils also, add the
9330  uncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.
9331  
9332  
9333  CHAPTER 51. The Spirit-Spout.
9334  
9335  Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly
9336  swept across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off
9337  the Cape de Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of
9338  the Rio de la Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery
9339  locality, southerly from St. Helena.
9340  
9341  It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and
9342  moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver;
9343  and, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery
9344  silence, not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen
9345  far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it
9346  looked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from
9347  the sea. Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these moonlight
9348  nights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a
9349  look-out there, with the same precision as if it had been day. And yet,
9350  though herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a
9351  hundred would venture a lowering for them. You may think with what
9352  emotions, then, the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at
9353  such unusual hours; his turban and the moon, companions in one sky. But
9354  when, after spending his uniform interval there for several successive
9355  nights without uttering a single sound; when, after all this silence,
9356  his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet,
9357  every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit
9358  had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew. “There she
9359  blows!” Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered
9360  more; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. For though it was
9361  a most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously
9362  exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a
9363  lowering.
9364  
9365  Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the
9366  t’gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. The
9367  best man in the ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head
9368  manned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind. The strange,
9369  upheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows
9370  of so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air
9371  beneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic
9372  influences were struggling in her—one to mount direct to heaven, the
9373  other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched
9374  Ahab’s face that night, you would have thought that in him also two
9375  different things were warring. While his one live leg made lively
9376  echoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a
9377  coffin-tap. On life and death this old man walked. But though the ship
9378  so swiftly sped, and though from every eye, like arrows, the eager
9379  glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night. Every
9380  sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.
9381  
9382  This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days
9383  after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it
9384  was descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it
9385  disappeared as if it had never been. And so it served us night after
9386  night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it. Mysteriously jetted
9387  into the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case might be;
9388  disappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or three; and
9389  somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still
9390  further and further in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever
9391  alluring us on.
9392  
9393  Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance
9394  with the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested
9395  the Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that
9396  whenever and wherever descried; at however remote times, or in however
9397  far apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by
9398  one self-same whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there
9399  reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as
9400  if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that the
9401  monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest
9402  and most savage seas.
9403  
9404  These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a
9405  wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in
9406  which, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a
9407  devilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along, through seas so
9408  wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful
9409  errand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow.
9410  
9411  But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began
9412  howling around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas
9413  that are there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the
9414  blast, and gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of
9415  silver chips, the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this
9416  desolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to sights more
9417  dismal than before.
9418  
9419  Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither
9420  before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And
9421  every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and
9422  spite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp,
9423  as though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a
9424  thing appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for
9425  their homeless selves. And heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved
9426  the black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the great
9427  mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering
9428  it had bred.
9429  
9430  Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoso, as called
9431  of yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had
9432  attended us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where
9433  guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed
9434  condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat
9435  that black air without any horizon. But calm, snow-white, and
9436  unvarying; still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky; still
9437  beckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would at times be
9438  descried.
9439  
9440  During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for
9441  the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous
9442  deck, manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever
9443  addressed his mates. In tempestuous times like these, after everything
9444  above and aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done but
9445  passively to await the issue of the gale. Then Captain and crew become
9446  practical fatalists. So, with his ivory leg inserted into its
9447  accustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for
9448  hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an
9449  occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very
9450  eyelashes together. Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part of
9451  the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows,
9452  stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better to
9453  guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a
9454  sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a loosened
9455  belt. Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as if manned by
9456  painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the swift
9457  madness and gladness of the demoniac waves. By night the same muteness
9458  of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in silence
9459  the men swung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab stood up to the
9460  blast. Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not
9461  seek that repose in his hammock. Never could Starbuck forget the old
9462  man’s aspect, when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the
9463  barometer stood, he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his
9464  floor-screwed chair; the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from
9465  which he had some time before emerged, still slowly dripping from the
9466  unremoved hat and coat. On the table beside him lay unrolled one of
9467  those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken
9468  of. His lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand. Though the body
9469  was erect, the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were
9470  pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in
9471  the ceiling.*
9472  
9473  *The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to
9474  the compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself
9475  of the course of the ship.
9476  
9477  Terrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this
9478  gale, still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.
9479  
9480  
9481  CHAPTER 52. The Albatross.
9482  
9483  South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising
9484  ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross)
9485  by name. As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the
9486  fore-mast-head, I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro
9487  in the far ocean fisheries—a whaler at sea, and long absent from home.
9488  
9489  As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the
9490  skeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral
9491  appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all
9492  her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred
9493  over with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it
9494  was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads. They
9495  seemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment
9496  that had survived nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops
9497  nailed to the mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and
9498  though, when the ship slowly glided close under our stern, we six men
9499  in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped
9500  from the mast-heads of one ship to those of the other; yet, those
9501  forlorn-looking fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not
9502  one word to our own look-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being
9503  heard from below.
9504  
9505  “Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?”
9506  
9507  But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in
9508  the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his
9509  hand into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to
9510  make himself heard without it. Meantime his ship was still increasing
9511  the distance between. While in various silent ways the seamen of the
9512  Pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the
9513  first mere mention of the White Whale’s name to another ship, Ahab for
9514  a moment paused; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a
9515  boat to board the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. But
9516  taking advantage of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet,
9517  and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer
9518  and shortly bound home, he loudly hailed—“Ahoy there! This is the
9519  Pequod, bound round the world! Tell them to address all future letters
9520  to the Pacific ocean! and this time three years, if I am not at home,
9521  tell them to address them to ——”
9522  
9523  At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then,
9524  in accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish,
9525  that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side,
9526  darted away with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves
9527  fore and aft with the stranger’s flanks. Though in the course of his
9528  continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar
9529  sight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously
9530  carry meanings.
9531  
9532  “Swim away from me, do ye?” murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water.
9533  There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of
9534  deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced.
9535  But turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in
9536  the wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion
9537  voice,—“Up helm! Keep her off round the world!”
9538  
9539  Round the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings;
9540  but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through
9541  numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that
9542  we left behind secure, were all the time before us.
9543  
9544  Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for
9545  ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange
9546  than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise
9547  in the voyage. But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in
9548  tormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims
9549  before all human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe, they
9550  either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.
9551  
9552  
9553  CHAPTER 53. The Gam.
9554  
9555  The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had
9556  spoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms. But even had this
9557  not been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded
9558  her—judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions—if so it had
9559  been that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative answer
9560  to the question he put. For, as it eventually turned out, he cared not
9561  to consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain, except he
9562  could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought. But
9563  all this might remain inadequately estimated, were not something said
9564  here of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other
9565  in foreign seas, and especially on a common cruising-ground.
9566  
9567  If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the
9568  equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering
9569  each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of
9570  them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment
9571  to interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and
9572  resting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the
9573  illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling
9574  vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth—off lone
9575  Fanning’s Island, or the far away King’s Mills; how much more natural,
9576  I say, that under such circumstances these ships should not only
9577  interchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and
9578  sociable contact. And especially would this seem to be a matter of
9579  course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose
9580  captains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to
9581  each other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to
9582  talk about.
9583  
9584  For the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on
9585  board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a
9586  date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and
9587  thumb-worn files. And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound
9588  ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the
9589  cruising-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost
9590  importance to her. And in degree, all this will hold true concerning
9591  whaling vessels crossing each other’s track on the cruising-ground
9592  itself, even though they are equally long absent from home. For one of
9593  them may have received a transfer of letters from some third, and now
9594  far remote vessel; and some of those letters may be for the people of
9595  the ship she now meets. Besides, they would exchange the whaling news,
9596  and have an agreeable chat. For not only would they meet with all the
9597  sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculiar
9598  congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared
9599  privations and perils.
9600  
9601  Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference;
9602  that is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case
9603  with Americans and English. Though, to be sure, from the small number
9604  of English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and when
9605  they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them;
9606  for your Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does not
9607  fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the English
9608  whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the
9609  American whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his
9610  nondescript provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this
9611  superiority in the English whalemen does really consist, it would be
9612  hard to say, seeing that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill
9613  more whales than all the English, collectively, in ten years. But this
9614  is a harmless little foible in the English whale-hunters, which the
9615  Nantucketer does not take much to heart; probably, because he knows
9616  that he has a few foibles himself.
9617  
9618  So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the
9619  whalers have most reason to be sociable—and they are so. Whereas, some
9620  merchant ships crossing each other’s wake in the mid-Atlantic, will
9621  oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition,
9622  mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies
9623  in Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism
9624  upon each other’s rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at
9625  sea, they first go through such a string of silly bowings and
9626  scrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be
9627  much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As
9628  touching Slave-ships meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry,
9629  they run away from each other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates,
9630  when they chance to cross each other’s cross-bones, the first hail
9631  is—“How many skulls?”—the same way that whalers hail—“How many
9632  barrels?” And that question once answered, pirates straightway steer
9633  apart, for they are infernal villains on both sides, and don’t like to
9634  see overmuch of each other’s villanous likenesses.
9635  
9636  But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,
9637  free-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another
9638  whaler in any sort of decent weather? She has a “_Gam_,” a thing so
9639  utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name
9640  even; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it,
9641  and repeat gamesome stuff about “spouters” and “blubber-boilers,” and
9642  such like pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and
9643  also all Pirates and Man-of-War’s men, and Slave-ship sailors, cherish
9644  such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it
9645  would be hard to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should
9646  like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory
9647  about it. It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at
9648  the gallows. And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion,
9649  he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude. Hence, I
9650  conclude, that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman,
9651  in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on.
9652  
9653  But what is a _Gam?_ You might wear out your index-finger running up
9654  and down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word. Dr.
9655  Johnson never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster’s ark does not
9656  hold it. Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years
9657  been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees.
9658  Certainly, it needs a definition, and should be incorporated into the
9659  Lexicon. With that view, let me learnedly define it.
9660  
9661  GAM. NOUN—_A social meeting of two_ (_or more_) _Whaleships, generally
9662  on a cruising-ground; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange
9663  visits by boats’ crews: the two captains remaining, for the time, on
9664  board of one ship, and the two chief mates on the other._
9665  
9666  There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten
9667  here. All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so
9668  has the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the
9669  captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern
9670  sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often
9671  steers himself with a pretty little milliner’s tiller decorated with
9672  gay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa
9673  of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if
9674  whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old
9675  aldermen in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never
9676  admits of any such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete
9677  boat’s crew must leave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or
9678  harpooneer is of the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the
9679  occasion, and the captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled off to
9680  his visit all standing like a pine tree. And often you will notice that
9681  being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him
9682  from the sides of the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to
9683  the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor
9684  is this any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting
9685  steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the
9686  after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front. He is thus
9687  completely wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself
9688  sideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent
9689  pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of
9690  foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make a
9691  spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again,
9692  it would never do in plain sight of the world’s riveted eyes, it would
9693  never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying
9694  himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his
9695  hands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he
9696  generally carries his hands in his trowsers’ pockets; but perhaps being
9697  generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ballast.
9698  Nevertheless there have occurred instances, well authenticated ones
9699  too, where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment
9700  or two, in a sudden squall say—to seize hold of the nearest oarsman’s
9701  hair, and hold on there like grim death.
9702  
9703  
9704  CHAPTER 54. The Town-Ho’s Story.
9705  
9706  (_As told at the Golden Inn._)
9707  
9708  The Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is
9709  much like some noted four corners of a great highway, where you meet
9710  more travellers than in any other part.
9711  
9712  It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another
9713  homeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered. She was manned
9714  almost wholly by Polynesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave us
9715  strong news of Moby Dick. To some the general interest in the White
9716  Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho’s
9717  story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain
9718  wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of
9719  God which at times are said to overtake some men. This latter
9720  circumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may
9721  be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never
9722  reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates. For that secret part of
9723  the story was unknown to the captain of the Town-Ho himself. It was the
9724  private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship, one of
9725  whom, it seems, communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of
9726  secrecy, but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and
9727  revealed so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he could
9728  not well withhold the rest. Nevertheless, so potent an influence did
9729  this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full
9730  knowledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were
9731  they governed in this matter, that they kept the secret among
9732  themselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod’s main-mast.
9733  Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as
9734  publicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair I now
9735  proceed to put on lasting record.
9736  
9737  *The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head,
9738  still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin.
9739  
9740  For my humor’s sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once
9741  narrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one
9742  saint’s eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden
9743  Inn. Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were
9744  on the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding questions they
9745  occasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.
9746  
9747  “Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about
9748  rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket,
9749  was cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days’ sail eastward
9750  from the eaves of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the
9751  northward of the Line. One morning upon handling the pumps, according
9752  to daily usage, it was observed that she made more water in her hold
9753  than common. They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. But
9754  the captain, having some unusual reason for believing that rare good
9755  luck awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to
9756  quit them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous,
9757  though, indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low
9758  down as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued
9759  her cruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy
9760  intervals; but no good luck came; more days went by, and not only was
9761  the leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much so, that
9762  now taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the
9763  nearest harbor among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and
9764  repaired.
9765  
9766  “Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance
9767  favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the
9768  way, because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically
9769  relieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the
9770  ship free; never mind if the leak should double on her. In truth, well
9771  nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous
9772  breezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at
9773  her port without the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been
9774  for the brutal overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the
9775  bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from
9776  Buffalo.
9777  
9778  “‘Lakeman!—Buffalo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?’
9779  said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.
9780  
9781  “On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but—I crave your
9782  courtesy—may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. Now,
9783  gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as
9784  large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far
9785  Manilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had yet
9786  been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly
9787  connected with the open ocean. For in their interflowing aggregate,
9788  those grand fresh-water seas of ours,—Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and
9789  Superior, and Michigan,—possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many
9790  of the ocean’s noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of
9791  races and of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic
9792  isles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by
9793  two great contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long
9794  maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East,
9795  dotted all round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by
9796  batteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they
9797  have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they
9798  yield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash
9799  from out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by
9800  ancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried
9801  lines of kings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild
9802  Afric beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give
9803  robes to Tartar Emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and
9804  Cleveland, as well as Winnebago villages; they float alike the
9805  full-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer,
9806  and the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as
9807  direful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks
9808  are, for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full
9809  many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen,
9810  though an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean
9811  nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for Radney,
9812  though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket
9813  beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long
9814  followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was
9815  he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods
9816  seaman, fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled Bowie-knives. Yet
9817  was this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this
9818  Lakeman, a mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by
9819  inflexible firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human
9820  recognition which is the meanest slave’s right; thus treated, this
9821  Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile. At all events, he
9822  had proved so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and
9823  Steelkilt—but, gentlemen, you shall hear.
9824  
9825  “It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her
9826  prow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho’s leak seemed again
9827  increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps
9828  every day. You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our
9829  Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping their
9830  whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should the
9831  officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the
9832  probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again
9833  remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom.
9834  Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward,
9835  gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their
9836  pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length;
9837  that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other
9838  reasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel is
9839  in some very out of the way part of those waters, some really landless
9840  latitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.
9841  
9842  “Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found
9843  gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by
9844  several of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded the
9845  upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way
9846  expanded to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a
9847  coward, and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness
9848  touching his own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or
9849  on sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when he
9850  betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the
9851  seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner
9852  in her. So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was
9853  on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they
9854  stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear
9855  water; clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen—that bubbling from the
9856  pumps ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at
9857  the lee scupper-holes.
9858  
9859  “Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional
9860  world of ours—watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in command
9861  over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his
9862  superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he
9863  conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a
9864  chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern’s tower, and make
9865  a little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may,
9866  gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a
9867  head like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled
9868  housings of your last viceroy’s snorting charger; and a brain, and a
9869  heart, and a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt
9870  Charlemagne, had he been born son to Charlemagne’s father. But Radney,
9871  the mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.
9872  He did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.
9873  
9874  “Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the
9875  rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with
9876  his gay banterings.
9877  
9878  “‘Aye, aye, my merry lads, it’s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,
9879  one of ye, and let’s have a taste. By the Lord, it’s worth bottling! I
9880  tell ye what, men, old Rad’s investment must go for it! he had best cut
9881  away his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that
9882  sword-fish only began the job; he’s come back again with a gang of
9883  ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole
9884  posse of ’em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom;
9885  making improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I’d tell him
9886  to jump overboard and scatter ’em. They’re playing the devil with his
9887  estate, I can tell him. But he’s a simple old soul,—Rad, and a beauty
9888  too. Boys, they say the rest of his property is invested in
9889  looking-glasses. I wonder if he’d give a poor devil like me the model
9890  of his nose.’
9891  
9892  “‘Damn your eyes! what’s that pump stopping for?’ roared Radney,
9893  pretending not to have heard the sailors’ talk. ‘Thunder away at it!’
9894  
9895  “‘Aye, aye, sir,’ said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. ‘Lively, boys,
9896  lively, now!’ And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines;
9897  the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping
9898  of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life’s
9899  utmost energies.
9900  
9901  “Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went
9902  forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face
9903  fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his
9904  brow. Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney
9905  to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know
9906  not; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate
9907  commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a
9908  shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a
9909  pig to run at large.
9910  
9911  “Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship’s deck at sea is a piece of household
9912  work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every
9913  evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually
9914  foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of
9915  sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom
9916  would not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all
9917  vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys,
9918  if boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the
9919  Town-Ho that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps;
9920  and being the most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been
9921  regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should
9922  have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly
9923  nautical duties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention all
9924  these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair
9925  stood between the two men.
9926  
9927  “But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as
9928  plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat
9929  in his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will
9930  understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman
9931  fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat
9932  still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate’s
9933  malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him
9934  and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he
9935  instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness
9936  to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being—a
9937  repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really valiant men even when
9938  aggrieved—this nameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over
9939  Steelkilt.
9940  
9941  “Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily
9942  exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping
9943  the deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then,
9944  without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the
9945  customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done
9946  little or nothing all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a
9947  most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his
9948  command; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an
9949  uplifted cooper’s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near
9950  by.
9951  
9952  “Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for
9953  all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt
9954  could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still
9955  smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he remained
9956  doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the
9957  hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do
9958  his bidding.
9959  
9960  “Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily
9961  followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated
9962  his intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had
9963  not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with
9964  his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it
9965  was to no purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the
9966  windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him
9967  that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the
9968  Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:
9969  
9970  “‘Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to
9971  yourself.’ But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where
9972  the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of
9973  his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions.
9974  Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye
9975  with the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his
9976  right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his
9977  persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would
9978  murder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter
9979  by the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant
9980  the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch
9981  spouting blood like a whale.
9982  
9983  “Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays
9984  leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their
9985  mastheads. They were both Canallers.
9986  
9987  “‘Canallers!’ cried Don Pedro. ‘We have seen many whale-ships in our
9988  harbours, but never heard of your Canallers. Pardon: who and what are
9989  they?’
9990  
9991  “‘Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal.
9992  You must have heard of it.’
9993  
9994  “‘Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and hereditary
9995  land, we know but little of your vigorous North.’
9996  
9997  “‘Aye? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your chicha’s very fine; and ere
9998  proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for such
9999  information may throw side-light upon my story.’
10000 
10001 “For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire
10002 breadth of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities and
10003 most thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and
10004 affluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room
10005 and bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great forests; on Roman
10006 arches over Indian rivers; through sun and shade; by happy hearts or
10007 broken; through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk
10008 counties; and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, whose spires
10009 stand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream of Venetianly
10010 corrupt and often lawless life. There’s your true Ashantee, gentlemen;
10011 there howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you;
10012 under the long-flung shadow, and the snug patronising lee of churches.
10013 For by some curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan
10014 freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so
10015 sinners, gentlemen, most abound in holiest vicinities.
10016 
10017 “‘Is that a friar passing?’ said Don Pedro, looking downwards into the
10018 crowded plazza, with humorous concern.
10019 
10020 “‘Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella’s Inquisition wanes in
10021 Lima,’ laughed Don Sebastian. ‘Proceed, Senor.’
10022 
10023 “‘A moment! Pardon!’ cried another of the company. ‘In the name of all
10024 us Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we have by
10025 no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for
10026 distant Venice in your corrupt comparison. Oh! do not bow and look
10027 surprised; you know the proverb all along this coast—“Corrupt as Lima.”
10028 It but bears out your saying, too; churches more plentiful than
10029 billiard-tables, and for ever open—and “Corrupt as Lima.” So, too,
10030 Venice; I have been there; the holy city of the blessed evangelist, St.
10031 Mark!—St. Dominic, purge it! Your cup! Thanks: here I refill; now, you
10032 pour out again.’
10033 
10034 “Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would
10035 make a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is
10036 he. Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery
10037 Nile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked
10038 Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore,
10039 all this effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish guise which the Canaller
10040 so proudly sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his
10041 grand features. A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages
10042 through which he floats; his swart visage and bold swagger are not
10043 unshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have received
10044 good turns from one of these Canallers; I thank him heartily; would
10045 fain be not ungrateful; but it is often one of the prime redeeming
10046 qualities of your man of violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm
10047 to back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one. In
10048 sum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is
10049 emphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so
10050 many of its most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of
10051 mankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling
10052 captains. Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter,
10053 that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its
10054 line, the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole
10055 transition between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and
10056 recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.
10057 
10058 “‘I see! I see!’ impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his chicha
10059 upon his silvery ruffles. ‘No need to travel! The world’s one Lima. I
10060 had thought, now, that at your temperate North the generations were
10061 cold and holy as the hills.—But the story.’
10062 
10063 “I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay. Hardly
10064 had he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and
10065 the four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. But sliding down
10066 the ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the
10067 uproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle.
10068 Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted
10069 turmoil ensued; while standing out of harm’s way, the valiant captain
10070 danced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to
10071 manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to the
10072 quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close up to the revolving border of
10073 the confusion, and prying into the heart of it with his pike, sought to
10074 prick out the object of his resentment. But Steelkilt and his
10075 desperadoes were too much for them all; they succeeded in gaining the
10076 forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing about three or four large casks
10077 in a line with the windlass, these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves
10078 behind the barricade.
10079 
10080 “‘Come out of that, ye pirates!’ roared the captain, now menacing them
10081 with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. ‘Come
10082 out of that, ye cut-throats!’
10083 
10084 “Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there,
10085 defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to
10086 understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt’s) death would be the signal
10087 for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart
10088 lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but
10089 still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.
10090 
10091 “‘Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?’ demanded their
10092 ringleader.
10093 
10094 “‘Turn to! turn to!—I make no promise;—to your duty! Do you want to
10095 sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!’ and he
10096 once more raised a pistol.
10097 
10098 “‘Sink the ship?’ cried Steelkilt. ‘Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us
10099 turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What
10100 say ye, men?’ turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their
10101 response.
10102 
10103 “The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye
10104 on the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:—‘It’s not our
10105 fault; we didn’t want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was
10106 boy’s business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to
10107 prick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against his
10108 cursed jaw; ain’t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there,
10109 men? look to those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God, look to
10110 yourself; say the word; don’t be a fool; forget it all; we are ready to
10111 turn to; treat us decently, and we’re your men; but we won’t be
10112 flogged.’
10113 
10114 “‘Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!’
10115 
10116 “‘Look ye, now,’ cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him,
10117 ‘there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for
10118 the cruise, d’ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our
10119 discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don’t want a row; it’s
10120 not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but we
10121 won’t be flogged.’
10122 
10123 “‘Turn to!’ roared the Captain.
10124 
10125 “Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:—‘I tell you what
10126 it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby
10127 rascal, we won’t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but till
10128 you say the word about not flogging us, we don’t do a hand’s turn.’
10129 
10130 “‘Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I’ll keep ye there till
10131 ye’re sick of it. Down ye go.’
10132 
10133 “‘Shall we?’ cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against
10134 it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him down
10135 into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.
10136 
10137 “As the Lakeman’s bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain
10138 and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide
10139 of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called
10140 for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the
10141 companionway. Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered
10142 something down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them—ten
10143 in number—leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had
10144 remained neutral.
10145 
10146 “All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and
10147 aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at
10148 which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after
10149 breaking through the bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed
10150 in peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the
10151 pumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary
10152 night dismally resounded through the ship.
10153 
10154 “At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck,
10155 summoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. Water was
10156 then lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were
10157 tossed after it; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it,
10158 the Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice every day for three
10159 days this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling,
10160 and then a scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered;
10161 and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were
10162 ready to turn to. The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet,
10163 united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained
10164 them to surrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain
10165 reiterated his demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a
10166 terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he
10167 belonged. On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up
10168 into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain
10169 them. Only three were left.
10170 
10171 “‘Better turn to, now?’ said the Captain with a heartless jeer.
10172 
10173 “‘Shut us up again, will ye!’ cried Steelkilt.
10174 
10175 “‘Oh certainly,’ said the Captain, and the key clicked.
10176 
10177 “It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of
10178 seven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had
10179 last hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as
10180 black as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to
10181 the two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst
10182 out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with
10183 their keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements with a
10184 handle at each end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if
10185 by any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. For
10186 himself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not.
10187 That was the last night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met
10188 with no opposition on the part of the other two; they swore they were
10189 ready for that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a
10190 surrender. And what was more, they each insisted upon being the first
10191 man on deck, when the time to make the rush should come. But to this
10192 their leader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself;
10193 particularly as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other,
10194 in the matter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder
10195 would but admit one man at a time. And here, gentlemen, the foul play
10196 of these miscreants must come out.
10197 
10198 “Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own
10199 separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece
10200 of treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be
10201 the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and
10202 thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might
10203 merit. But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead
10204 them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of
10205 villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their
10206 leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in
10207 three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with
10208 cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.
10209 
10210 “Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he
10211 and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a
10212 few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still
10213 struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious
10214 allies, who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been
10215 fully ripe for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along
10216 the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the
10217 mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till
10218 morning. ‘Damn ye,’ cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them,
10219 ‘the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!’
10220 
10221 “At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had
10222 rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the
10223 former that he had a good mind to flog them all round—thought, upon the
10224 whole, he would do so—he ought to—justice demanded it; but for the
10225 present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with
10226 a reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.
10227 
10228 “‘But as for you, ye carrion rogues,’ turning to the three men in the
10229 rigging—‘for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;’ and, seizing
10230 a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two
10231 traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads
10232 sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.
10233 
10234 “‘My wrist is sprained with ye!’ he cried, at last; ‘but there is still
10235 rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn’t give up. Take
10236 that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.’
10237 
10238 “For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his
10239 cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a
10240 sort of hiss, ‘What I say is this—and mind it well—if you flog me, I
10241 murder you!’
10242 
10243 “‘Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me’—and the Captain drew off with
10244 the rope to strike.
10245 
10246 “‘Best not,’ hissed the Lakeman.
10247 
10248 “‘But I must,’—and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.
10249 
10250 “Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the Captain;
10251 who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck
10252 rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope,
10253 said, ‘I won’t do it—let him go—cut him down: d’ye hear?’
10254 
10255 “But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale
10256 man, with a bandaged head, arrested them—Radney the chief mate. Ever
10257 since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the
10258 tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the
10259 whole scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly
10260 speak; but mumbling something about _his_ being willing and able to do
10261 what the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced
10262 to his pinioned foe.
10263 
10264 “‘You are a coward!’ hissed the Lakeman.
10265 
10266 “‘So I am, but take that.’ The mate was in the very act of striking,
10267 when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing
10268 no more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt’s threat, whatever that
10269 might have been. The three men were then cut down, all hands were
10270 turned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps
10271 clanged as before.
10272 
10273 “Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor
10274 was heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up,
10275 besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew.
10276 Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own
10277 instance they were put down in the ship’s run for salvation. Still, no
10278 sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed,
10279 that mainly at Steelkilt’s instigation, they had resolved to maintain
10280 the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the
10281 ship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the
10282 speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing—namely,
10283 not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For,
10284 spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still
10285 maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower
10286 for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the
10287 cruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his
10288 berth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the
10289 vital jaw of the whale.
10290 
10291 “But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of
10292 passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till
10293 all was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the
10294 man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney
10295 the chief mate’s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more
10296 than half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he
10297 insisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the
10298 head of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other
10299 circumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.
10300 
10301 “During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the
10302 bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of
10303 the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship’s side. In
10304 this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a
10305 considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between
10306 this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his
10307 next trick at the helm would come round at two o’clock, in the morning
10308 of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his
10309 leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully
10310 in his watches below.
10311 
10312 “‘What are you making there?’ said a shipmate.
10313 
10314 “‘What do you think? what does it look like?’
10315 
10316 “‘Like a lanyard for your bag; but it’s an odd one, seems to me.’
10317 
10318 “‘Yes, rather oddish,’ said the Lakeman, holding it at arm’s length
10319 before him; ‘but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven’t enough
10320 twine,—have you any?’
10321 
10322 “But there was none in the forecastle.
10323 
10324 “‘Then I must get some from old Rad;’ and he rose to go aft.
10325 
10326 “‘You don’t mean to go a begging to _him!_’ said a sailor.
10327 
10328 “‘Why not? Do you think he won’t do me a turn, when it’s to help
10329 himself in the end, shipmate?’ and going to the mate, he looked at him
10330 quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given
10331 him—neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an
10332 iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the
10333 Lakeman’s monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock
10334 for a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent
10335 helm—nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready
10336 dug to the seaman’s hand—that fatal hour was then to come; and in the
10337 fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and
10338 stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.
10339 
10340 “But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody
10341 deed he had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the
10342 avenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in
10343 to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have
10344 done.
10345 
10346 “It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second
10347 day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe
10348 man, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, ‘There
10349 she rolls! there she rolls!’ Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.
10350 
10351 “‘Moby Dick!’ cried Don Sebastian; ‘St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do
10352 whales have christenings? Whom call you Moby Dick?’
10353 
10354 “‘A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don;—but
10355 that would be too long a story.’
10356 
10357 “‘How? how?’ cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.
10358 
10359 “‘Nay, Dons, Dons—nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now. Let me get more
10360 into the air, Sirs.’
10361 
10362 “‘The chicha! the chicha!’ cried Don Pedro; ‘our vigorous friend looks
10363 faint;—fill up his empty glass!’
10364 
10365 “No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.—Now, gentlemen, so
10366 suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the
10367 ship—forgetful of the compact among the crew—in the excitement of the
10368 moment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted
10369 his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it had been
10370 plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy.
10371 ‘The White Whale—the White Whale!’ was the cry from captain, mates, and
10372 harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to
10373 capture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed
10374 askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass,
10375 that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a
10376 living opal in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality
10377 pervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out
10378 before the world itself was charted. The mutineer was the bowsman of
10379 the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him,
10380 while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or
10381 slacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats
10382 were lowered, the mate’s got the start; and none howled more fiercely
10383 with delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a
10384 stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney
10385 sprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat.
10386 And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale’s topmost back.
10387 Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding
10388 foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat
10389 struck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the
10390 standing mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale’s slippery back,
10391 the boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was
10392 tossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck
10393 out through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that
10394 veil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But
10395 the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer
10396 between his jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again,
10397 and went down.
10398 
10399 “Meantime, at the first tap of the boat’s bottom, the Lakeman had
10400 slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly
10401 looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific,
10402 downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He
10403 cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose
10404 again, with some tatters of Radney’s red woollen shirt, caught in the
10405 teeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the
10406 whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.
10407 
10408 “In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port—a savage, solitary
10409 place—where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the
10410 Lakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted
10411 among the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double
10412 war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.
10413 
10414 “The ship’s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called
10415 upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving
10416 down the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over
10417 their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both
10418 by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent,
10419 that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a
10420 weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so
10421 heavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the
10422 ship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon
10423 from the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the
10424 Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with
10425 him, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight
10426 before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a
10427 reinforcement to his crew.
10428 
10429 “On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which
10430 seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from
10431 it; but the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of
10432 Steelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water. The
10433 captain presented a pistol. With one foot on each prow of the yoked
10434 war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the
10435 pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and
10436 foam.
10437 
10438 “‘What do you want of me?’ cried the captain.
10439 
10440 “‘Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?’ demanded Steelkilt;
10441 ‘no lies.’
10442 
10443 “‘I am bound to Tahiti for more men.’
10444 
10445 “‘Very good. Let me board you a moment—I come in peace.’ With that he
10446 leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale,
10447 stood face to face with the captain.
10448 
10449 “‘Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As
10450 soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder
10451 island, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightnings strike
10452 me!’
10453 
10454 “‘A pretty scholar,’ laughed the Lakeman. ‘Adios, Senor!’ and leaping
10455 into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.
10456 
10457 “Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the
10458 roots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due
10459 time arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck
10460 befriended him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were
10461 providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor
10462 headed. They embarked; and so for ever got the start of their former
10463 captain, had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution.
10464 
10465 “Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived,
10466 and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized
10467 Tahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small
10468 native schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all
10469 right there, again resumed his cruisings.
10470 
10471 “Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of
10472 Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to
10473 give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that
10474 destroyed him.  * * * *
10475 
10476 “‘Are you through?’ said Don Sebastian, quietly.
10477 
10478 “‘I am, Don.’
10479 
10480 “‘Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions,
10481 this your story is in substance really true? It is so passing
10482 wonderful! Did you get it from an unquestionable source? Bear with me
10483 if I seem to press.’
10484 
10485 “‘Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don
10486 Sebastian’s suit,’ cried the company, with exceeding interest.
10487 
10488 “‘Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn,
10489 gentlemen?’
10490 
10491 “‘Nay,’ said Don Sebastian; ‘but I know a worthy priest near by, who
10492 will quickly procure one for me. I go for it; but are you well advised?
10493 this may grow too serious.’
10494 
10495 “‘Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?’
10496 
10497 “‘Though there are no Auto-da-Fés in Lima now,’ said one of the company
10498 to another; ‘I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy.
10499 Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight. I see no need of this.’
10500 
10501 “‘Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also beg
10502 that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists
10503 you can.’
10504 
10505 * * * * * *
10506 
10507 “‘This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,’ said Don
10508 Sebastian, gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.
10509 
10510 “‘Let me remove my hat. Now, venerable priest, further into the light,
10511 and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it.
10512 
10513 “‘So help me Heaven, and on my honor the story I have told ye,
10514 gentlemen, is in substance and its great items, true. I know it to be
10515 true; it happened on this ball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew; I
10516 have seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney.’”
10517 
10518 
10519 CHAPTER 55. Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.
10520 
10521 I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,
10522 something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the
10523 eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored
10524 alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there.
10525 It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to those curious
10526 imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day
10527 confidently challenge the faith of the landsman. It is time to set the
10528 world right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all
10529 wrong.
10530 
10531 It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will
10532 be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For
10533 ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble
10534 panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields,
10535 medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of
10536 chain-armor like Saladin’s, and a helmeted head like St. George’s; ever
10537 since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed, not
10538 only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific
10539 presentations of him.
10540 
10541 Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting
10542 to be the whale’s, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of
10543 Elephanta, in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless
10544 sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits,
10545 every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of
10546 them actually came into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our
10547 noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The
10548 Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall,
10549 depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly
10550 known as the Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is half man and
10551 half whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small
10552 section of him is all wrong. It looks more like the tapering tail of an
10553 anaconda, than the broad palms of the true whale’s majestic flukes.
10554 
10555 But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian
10556 painter’s portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the
10557 antediluvian Hindoo. It is Guido’s picture of Perseus rescuing
10558 Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model
10559 of such a strange creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting the
10560 same scene in his own “Perseus Descending,” make out one whit better.
10561 The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the
10562 surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on
10563 its back, and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are
10564 rolling, might be taken for the Traitors’ Gate leading from the Thames
10565 by water into the Tower. Then, there are the Prodromus whales of old
10566 Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah’s whale, as depicted in the prints of old
10567 Bibles and the cuts of old primers. What shall be said of these? As for
10568 the book-binder’s whale winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a
10569 descending anchor—as stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of
10570 many books both old and new—that is a very picturesque but purely
10571 fabulous creature, imitated, I take it, from the like figures on
10572 antique vases. Though universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless
10573 call this book-binder’s fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so
10574 intended when the device was first introduced. It was introduced by an
10575 old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the
10576 Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a
10577 comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a
10578 species of the Leviathan.
10579 
10580 In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you
10581 will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all
10582 manner of spouts, jets d’eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and
10583 Baden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the
10584 title-page of the original edition of the “Advancement of Learning” you
10585 will find some curious whales.
10586 
10587 But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those
10588 pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations,
10589 by those who know. In old Harris’s collection of voyages there are some
10590 plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671,
10591 entitled “A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the
10592 Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.” In one of those plates the
10593 whales, like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among
10594 ice-isles, with white bears running over their living backs. In another
10595 plate, the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with
10596 perpendicular flukes.
10597 
10598 Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain
10599 Colnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled “A Voyage round
10600 Cape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the
10601 Spermaceti Whale Fisheries.” In this book is an outline purporting to
10602 be a “Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from
10603 one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck.”
10604 I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the
10605 benefit of his marines. To mention but one thing about it, let me say
10606 that it has an eye which applied, according to the accompanying scale,
10607 to a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye of that whale a
10608 bow-window some five feet long. Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not
10609 give us Jonah looking out of that eye!
10610 
10611 Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the
10612 benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of
10613 mistake. Look at that popular work “Goldsmith’s Animated Nature.” In
10614 the abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged
10615 “whale” and a “narwhale.” I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this
10616 unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for the
10617 narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this
10618 nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon
10619 any intelligent public of schoolboys.
10620 
10621 Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacépède, a great
10622 naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are
10623 several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan. All these
10624 are not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland
10625 whale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a long
10626 experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have its
10627 counterpart in nature.
10628 
10629 But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was
10630 reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous
10631 Baron. In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he
10632 gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that
10633 picture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary
10634 retreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier’s Sperm Whale is
10635 not a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of
10636 a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that
10637 picture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor
10638 in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that
10639 is, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the
10640 pencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.
10641 
10642 As for the sign-painters’ whales seen in the streets hanging over the
10643 shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally
10644 Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage;
10645 breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of
10646 mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue
10647 paint.
10648 
10649 But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very
10650 surprising after all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have
10651 been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a
10652 drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent
10653 the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars.
10654 Though elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living
10655 Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The
10656 living whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen
10657 at sea in unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out
10658 of sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element
10659 it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily
10660 into the air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.
10661 And, not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour
10662 between a young sucking whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan;
10663 yet, even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a
10664 ship’s deck, such is then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying
10665 shape of him, that his precise expression the devil himself could not
10666 catch.
10667 
10668 But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded
10669 whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at
10670 all. For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,
10671 that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape. Though
10672 Jeremy Bentham’s skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of
10673 one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed
10674 utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy’s other leading personal
10675 characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any
10676 leviathan’s articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the
10677 mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully
10678 invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so
10679 roundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the
10680 head, as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is
10681 also very curiously displayed in the side fin, the bones of which
10682 almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand, minus only the
10683 thumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring,
10684 and little finger. But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy
10685 covering, as the human fingers in an artificial covering. “However
10686 recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us,” said humorous Stubb one
10687 day, “he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens.”
10688 
10689 For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs
10690 conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world
10691 which must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the
10692 mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very
10693 considerable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding
10694 out precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in
10695 which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is by
10696 going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of
10697 being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you
10698 had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this
10699 Leviathan.
10700 
10701 
10702 CHAPTER 56. Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True
10703 Pictures of Whaling Scenes.
10704 
10705 In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly
10706 tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them
10707 which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,
10708 especially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass
10709 that matter by.
10710 
10711 I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;
10712 Colnett’s, Huggins’s, Frederick Cuvier’s, and Beale’s. In the previous
10713 chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to. Huggins’s is far
10714 better than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale’s is the best. All
10715 Beale’s drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in
10716 the picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his second
10717 chapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no
10718 doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is
10719 admirably correct and life-like in its general effect. Some of the
10720 Sperm Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour;
10721 but they are wretchedly engraved. That is not his fault though.
10722 
10723 Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they
10724 are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has
10725 but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency,
10726 because it is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you
10727 can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by
10728 his living hunters.
10729 
10730 But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details
10731 not the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be
10732 anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed, and
10733 taken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent
10734 attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble
10735 Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath
10736 the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the
10737 air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of
10738 the boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the
10739 monster’s spine; and standing in that prow, for that one single
10740 incomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the
10741 incensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if
10742 from a precipice. The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and
10743 true. The half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden
10744 poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the
10745 swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions
10746 of affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing
10747 down upon the scene. Serious fault might be found with the anatomical
10748 details of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I
10749 could not draw so good a one.
10750 
10751 In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside
10752 the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his
10753 black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the
10754 Patagonian cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so
10755 that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there
10756 must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are
10757 pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and
10758 maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent
10759 back. And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through
10760 the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and
10761 causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh
10762 the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer. Thus, the foreground is all
10763 raging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is the
10764 glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails of the
10765 powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered
10766 fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole
10767 inserted into his spout-hole.
10768 
10769 Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he
10770 was either practically conversant with his subject, or else
10771 marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the
10772 lads for painting action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe,
10773 and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing
10774 commotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the
10775 beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the consecutive great
10776 battles of France; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern
10777 Lights, and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a
10778 charge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that
10779 gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery.
10780 
10781 The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of
10782 things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings
10783 they have of their whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England’s
10784 experience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the
10785 Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only
10786 finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the
10787 whale hunt. For the most part, the English and American whale
10788 draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical
10789 outline of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale; which, so
10790 far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to
10791 sketching the profile of a pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned
10792 Right whaleman, after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland
10793 whale, and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and
10794 porpoises, treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks,
10795 chopping knives, and grapnels; and with the microscopic diligence of a
10796 Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six
10797 fac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals. I mean no disparagement
10798 to the excellent voyager (I honor him for a veteran), but in so
10799 important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured
10800 for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of
10801 the Peace.
10802 
10803 In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other
10804 French engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself
10805 “H. Durand.” One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present
10806 purpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet
10807 noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored,
10808 inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened
10809 sails of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms in the background,
10810 both drooping together in the breezeless air. The effect is very fine,
10811 when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen
10812 under one of their few aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving
10813 is quite a different affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in
10814 the very heart of the Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside;
10815 the vessel (in the act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to
10816 a quay; and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity,
10817 is about giving chase to whales in the distance. The harpoons and
10818 lances lie levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in
10819 its hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands
10820 half-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse. From the ship, the
10821 smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke
10822 over a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud, rising up
10823 with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of the
10824 excited seamen.
10825 
10826 
10827 CHAPTER 57. Of Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in
10828 Stone; in Mountains; in Stars.
10829 
10830 On Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a
10831 crippled beggar (or _kedger_, as the sailors say) holding a painted
10832 board before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his
10833 leg. There are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats
10834 (presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity) is
10835 being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale. Any time these ten
10836 years, they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and exhibited
10837 that stump to an incredulous world. But the time of his justification
10838 has now come. His three whales are as good whales as were ever
10839 published in Wapping, at any rate; and his stump as unquestionable a
10840 stump as any you will find in the western clearings. But, though for
10841 ever mounted on that stump, never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman
10842 make; but, with downcast eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own
10843 amputation.
10844 
10845 Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and Sag
10846 Harbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and
10847 whaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm
10848 Whale-teeth, or ladies’ busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone, and
10849 other like skrimshander articles, as the whalemen call the numerous
10850 little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough
10851 material, in their hours of ocean leisure. Some of them have little
10852 boxes of dentistical-looking implements, specially intended for the
10853 skrimshandering business. But, in general, they toil with their
10854 jack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor,
10855 they will turn you out anything you please, in the way of a mariner’s
10856 fancy.
10857 
10858 Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man
10859 to that condition in which God placed him, _i.e._ what is called
10860 savagery. Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. I
10861 myself am a savage, owning no allegiance but to the King of the
10862 Cannibals; and ready at any moment to rebel against him.
10863 
10864 Now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic
10865 hours, is his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient Hawaiian
10866 war-club or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of
10867 carving, is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon.
10868 For, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark’s tooth, that
10869 miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved; and it has
10870 cost steady years of steady application.
10871 
10872 As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With the
10873 same marvellous patience, and with the same single shark’s tooth, of
10874 his one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not
10875 quite as workmanlike, but as close packed in its maziness of design, as
10876 the Greek savage, Achilles’s shield; and full of barbaric spirit and
10877 suggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage, Albert
10878 Durer.
10879 
10880 Wooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of
10881 the noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the
10882 forecastles of American whalers. Some of them are done with much
10883 accuracy.
10884 
10885 At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung
10886 by the tail for knockers to the road-side door. When the porter is
10887 sleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best. But these knocking whales
10888 are seldom remarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some
10889 old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for
10890 weather-cocks; but they are so elevated, and besides that are to all
10891 intents and purposes so labelled with “_Hands off!_” you cannot examine
10892 them closely enough to decide upon their merit.
10893 
10894 In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken
10895 cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain,
10896 you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the
10897 Leviathan partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against
10898 them in a surf of green surges.
10899 
10900 Then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is
10901 continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from
10902 some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the
10903 profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges. But you must be
10904 a thorough whaleman, to see these sights; and not only that, but if you
10905 wish to return to such a sight again, you must be sure and take the
10906 exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand-point,
10907 else so chance-like are such observations of the hills, that your
10908 precise, previous stand-point would require a laborious re-discovery;
10909 like the Soloma Islands, which still remain incognita, though once
10910 high-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled them.
10911 
10912 Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace out
10913 great whales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of them; as
10914 when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies
10915 locked in battle among the clouds. Thus at the North have I chased
10916 Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright
10917 points that first defined him to me. And beneath the effulgent
10918 Antarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the chase
10919 against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and
10920 the Flying Fish.
10921 
10922 With a frigate’s anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for
10923 spurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies, to
10924 see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really
10925 lie encamped beyond my mortal sight!
10926 
10927 
10928 CHAPTER 58. Brit.
10929 
10930 Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows
10931 of brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale
10932 largely feeds. For leagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that
10933 we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden
10934 wheat.
10935 
10936 On the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from
10937 the attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly
10938 swam through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that
10939 wondrous Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated
10940 from the water that escaped at the lip.
10941 
10942 As morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their
10943 scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these
10944 monsters swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and leaving
10945 behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.*
10946 
10947 *That part of the sea known among whalemen as the “Brazil Banks” does
10948 not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there
10949 being shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable
10950 meadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually
10951 floating in those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased.
10952 
10953 But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at
10954 all reminded one of mowers. Seen from the mast-heads, especially when
10955 they paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms
10956 looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in
10957 the great hunting countries of India, the stranger at a distance will
10958 sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them
10959 to be such, taking them for bare, blackened elevations of the soil;
10960 even so, often, with him, who for the first time beholds this species
10961 of the leviathans of the sea. And even when recognised at last, their
10962 immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such
10963 bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct, in all parts, with
10964 the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse.
10965 
10966 Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the
10967 deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore. For though
10968 some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are
10969 of their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the
10970 thing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for
10971 example, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to
10972 the sagacious kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any
10973 generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.
10974 
10975 But though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the seas
10976 have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and
10977 repelling; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita,
10978 so that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his
10979 one superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the most terrific of
10980 all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen
10981 tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters;
10982 though but a moment’s consideration will teach, that however baby man
10983 may brag of his science and skill, and however much, in a flattering
10984 future, that science and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever,
10985 to the crack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize
10986 the stateliest, stiffest frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the
10987 continual repetition of these very impressions, man has lost that sense
10988 of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.
10989 
10990 The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese
10991 vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow.
10992 That same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships
10993 of last year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah’s flood is not yet subsided;
10994 two thirds of the fair world it yet covers.
10995 
10996 Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a
10997 miracle upon the other? Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews,
10998 when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and
10999 swallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in
11000 precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews.
11001 
11002 But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it
11003 is also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who
11004 murdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath
11005 spawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her
11006 own cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the
11007 rocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of
11008 ships. No mercy, no power but its own controls it. Panting and snorting
11009 like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean
11010 overruns the globe.
11011 
11012 Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures
11013 glide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously
11014 hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish
11015 brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the
11016 dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once
11017 more, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey
11018 upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the world began.
11019 
11020 Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile
11021 earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a
11022 strange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean
11023 surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one
11024 insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the
11025 horrors of the half known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that
11026 isle, thou canst never return!
11027 
11028 
11029 CHAPTER 59. Squid.
11030 
11031 Slowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on her
11032 way north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air impelling
11033 her keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering
11034 masts mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three mild palms on a
11035 plain. And still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, the lonely,
11036 alluring jet would be seen.
11037 
11038 But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural
11039 spread over the sea, however unattended with any stagnant calm; when
11040 the long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid
11041 across them, enjoining some secrecy; when the slippered waves whispered
11042 together as they softly ran on; in this profound hush of the visible
11043 sphere a strange spectre was seen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head.
11044 
11045 In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and
11046 higher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed before
11047 our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills. Thus glistening
11048 for a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank. Then once more arose,
11049 and silently gleamed. It seemed not a whale; and yet is this Moby Dick?
11050 thought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down, but on re-appearing once
11051 more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod,
11052 the negro yelled out—“There! there again! there she breaches! right
11053 ahead! The White Whale, the White Whale!”
11054 
11055 Upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the
11056 bees rush to the boughs. Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab stood on
11057 the bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave
11058 his orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction
11059 indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo.
11060 
11061 Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had
11062 gradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect the
11063 ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular
11064 whale he pursued; however this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed
11065 him; whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly
11066 perceive the white mass, than with a quick intensity he instantly gave
11067 orders for lowering.
11068 
11069 The four boats were soon on the water; Ahab’s in advance, and all
11070 swiftly pulling towards their prey. Soon it went down, and while, with
11071 oars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the same spot
11072 where it sank, once more it slowly rose. Almost forgetting for the
11073 moment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most wondrous
11074 phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind. A
11075 vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing
11076 cream-colour, lay floating on the water, innumerable long arms
11077 radiating from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest of
11078 anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach.
11079 No perceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable token of
11080 either sensation or instinct; but undulated there on the billows, an
11081 unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.
11082 
11083 As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still
11084 gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice
11085 exclaimed—“Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him, than to
11086 have seen thee, thou white ghost!”
11087 
11088 “What was it, Sir?” said Flask.
11089 
11090 “The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld,
11091 and returned to their ports to tell of it.”
11092 
11093 But Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel;
11094 the rest as silently following.
11095 
11096 Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected
11097 with the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it
11098 being so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with
11099 portentousness. So rarely is it beheld, that though one and all of them
11100 declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet very few
11101 of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature
11102 and form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm
11103 whale his only food. For though other species of whales find their food
11104 above water, and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the
11105 spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the
11106 surface; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what,
11107 precisely, that food consists. At times, when closely pursued, he will
11108 disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid; some
11109 of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. They
11110 fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings
11111 by them to the bed of the ocean; and that the sperm whale, unlike other
11112 species, is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it.
11113 
11114 There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop
11115 Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid. The manner in
11116 which the Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with
11117 some other particulars he narrates, in all this the two correspond. But
11118 much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he
11119 assigns it.
11120 
11121 By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious
11122 creature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of
11123 cuttle-fish, to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would
11124 seem to belong, but only as the Anak of the tribe.
11125 
11126 
11127 CHAPTER 60. The Line.
11128 
11129 With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as
11130 for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented,
11131 I have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.
11132 
11133 The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly
11134 vapored with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary
11135 ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable
11136 to the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to
11137 the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary
11138 quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which
11139 it must be subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in
11140 general by no means adds to the rope’s durability or strength, however
11141 much it may give it compactness and gloss.
11142 
11143 Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost
11144 entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not
11145 so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and
11146 I will add (since there is an æsthetics in all things), is much more
11147 handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark
11148 fellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian
11149 to behold.
11150 
11151 The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first
11152 sight, you would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment
11153 its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and
11154 twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal
11155 to three tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures
11156 something over two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is
11157 spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still
11158 though, but so as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely
11159 bedded “sheaves,” or layers of concentric spiralizations, without any
11160 hollow but the “heart,” or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of
11161 the cheese. As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in
11162 running out, infallibly take somebody’s arm, leg, or entire body off,
11163 the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub. Some
11164 harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business,
11165 carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a
11166 block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it from all
11167 possible wrinkles and twists.
11168 
11169 In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line
11170 being continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in
11171 this; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into
11172 the boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub,
11173 nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a
11174 rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in
11175 thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which
11176 will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a
11177 concentrated one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the
11178 American line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a
11179 prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.
11180 
11181 Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an
11182 eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the
11183 tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.
11184 This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First:
11185 In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a
11186 neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to
11187 threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the
11188 harpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug
11189 of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the first
11190 boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This
11191 arrangement is indispensable for common safety’s sake; for were the
11192 lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the
11193 whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking
11194 minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed
11195 boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of
11196 the sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.
11197 
11198 Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is
11199 taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is
11200 again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise
11201 upon the loom or handle of every man’s oar, so that it jogs against his
11202 wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they alternately
11203 sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the
11204 extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size
11205 of a common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it
11206 hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the
11207 boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being
11208 coiled upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale
11209 still a little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp—the
11210 rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to
11211 that connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too
11212 tedious to detail.
11213 
11214 Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,
11215 twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction. All the
11216 oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid
11217 eye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest
11218 snakes sportively festooning their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal
11219 woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies,
11220 and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any
11221 unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible
11222 contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus
11223 circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones
11224 to quiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet habit—strange thing! what
11225 cannot habit accomplish?—Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes,
11226 and brighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you
11227 will hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat, when thus
11228 hung in hangman’s nooses; and, like the six burghers of Calais before
11229 King Edward, the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of
11230 death, with a halter around every neck, as you may say.
11231 
11232 Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those
11233 repeated whaling disasters—some few of which are casually chronicled—of
11234 this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line, and lost.
11235 For, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat, is
11236 like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a
11237 steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and
11238 wheel, is grazing you. It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in
11239 the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle,
11240 and you are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest
11241 warning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and
11242 simultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a
11243 Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could
11244 never pierce you out.
11245 
11246 Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and
11247 prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself;
11248 for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and
11249 contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal
11250 powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the
11251 line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought
11252 into actual play—this is a thing which carries more of true terror than
11253 any other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men
11254 live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their
11255 necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death,
11256 that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life.
11257 And if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would
11258 not at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before
11259 your evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.
11260 
11261 
11262 CHAPTER 61. Stubb Kills a Whale.
11263 
11264 If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to
11265 Queequeg it was quite a different object.
11266 
11267 “When you see him ’quid,” said the savage, honing his harpoon in the
11268 bow of his hoisted boat, “then you quick see him ’parm whale.”
11269 
11270 The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special
11271 to engage them, the Pequod’s crew could hardly resist the spell of
11272 sleep induced by such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean
11273 through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively
11274 ground; that is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins,
11275 flying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than
11276 those off the Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.
11277 
11278 It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders
11279 leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed
11280 in what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in
11281 that dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of
11282 my body; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will,
11283 long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.
11284 
11285 Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the
11286 seamen at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy. So that
11287 at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every
11288 swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering
11289 helmsman. The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests; and across the
11290 wide trance of the sea, east nodded to west, and the sun over all.
11291 
11292 Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my
11293 hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved
11294 me; with a shock I came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not
11295 forty fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like
11296 the capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian
11297 hue, glistening in the sun’s rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating
11298 in the trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his
11299 vapory jet, the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of
11300 a warm afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck
11301 by some enchanter’s wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all
11302 at once started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from
11303 all parts of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from
11304 aloft, shouted forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and
11305 regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air.
11306 
11307 “Clear away the boats! Luff!” cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he
11308 dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.
11309 
11310 The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and
11311 ere the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the
11312 leeward, but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples
11313 as he swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed,
11314 Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak
11315 but in whispers. So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the
11316 boats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of
11317 the noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase,
11318 the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air,
11319 and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.
11320 
11321 “There go flukes!” was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by
11322 Stubb’s producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite
11323 was granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the
11324 whale rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker’s boat, and
11325 much nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the
11326 honor of the capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length
11327 become aware of his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore
11328 no longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play.
11329 And still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the
11330 assault.
11331 
11332 Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy,
11333 he was going “head out”; that part obliquely projecting from the mad
11334 yeast which he brewed.*
11335 
11336 *It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the
11337 entire interior of the sperm whale’s enormous head consists. Though
11338 apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about
11339 him. So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does
11340 so when going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth of the
11341 upper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water
11342 formation of the lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he
11343 thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish
11344 galliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat.
11345 
11346 “Start her, start her, my men! Don’t hurry yourselves; take plenty of
11347 time—but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that’s all,” cried
11348 Stubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. “Start her, now; give ’em
11349 the long and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy—start
11350 her, all; but keep cool, keep cool—cucumbers is the word—easy,
11351 easy—only start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the
11352 buried dead perpendicular out of their graves, boys—that’s all. Start
11353 her!”
11354 
11355 “Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!” screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some old
11356 war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat
11357 involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke
11358 which the eager Indian gave.
11359 
11360 But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. “Kee-hee!
11361 Kee-hee!” yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards on his seat,
11362 like a pacing tiger in his cage.
11363 
11364 “Ka-la! Koo-loo!” howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a
11365 mouthful of Grenadier’s steak. And thus with oars and yells the keels
11366 cut the sea. Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still
11367 encouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from
11368 his mouth. Like desperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the
11369 welcome cry was heard—“Stand up, Tashtego!—give it to him!” The harpoon
11370 was hurled. “Stern all!” The oarsmen backed water; the same moment
11371 something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists. It was
11372 the magical line. An instant before, Stubb had swiftly caught two
11373 additional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its
11374 increased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and
11375 mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe. As the line passed round
11376 and round the loggerhead; so also, just before reaching that point, it
11377 blisteringly passed through and through both of Stubb’s hands, from
11378 which the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at
11379 these times, had accidentally dropped. It was like holding an enemy’s
11380 sharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time
11381 striving to wrest it out of your clutch.
11382 
11383 “Wet the line! wet the line!” cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him
11384 seated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into
11385 it.* More turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place.
11386 The boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins.
11387 Stubb and Tashtego here changed places—stem for stern—a staggering
11388 business truly in that rocking commotion.
11389 
11390 *Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be
11391 stated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the
11392 running line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or
11393 bailer, is set apart for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most
11394 convenient.
11395 
11396 From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part
11397 of the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you
11398 would have thought the craft had two keels—one cleaving the water, the
11399 other the air—as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at
11400 once. A continual cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy
11401 in her wake; and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a
11402 little finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic
11403 gunwale into the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and main
11404 clinging to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall
11405 form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order
11406 to bring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics
11407 seemed passed as they shot on their way, till at length the whale
11408 somewhat slackened his flight.
11409 
11410 “Haul in—haul in!” cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round
11411 towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while
11412 yet the boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb,
11413 firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart
11414 into the flying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately
11415 sterning out of the way of the whale’s horrible wallow, and then
11416 ranging up for another fling.
11417 
11418 The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down
11419 a hill. His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which
11420 bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun
11421 playing upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection
11422 into every face, so that they all glowed to each other like red men.
11423 And all the while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot
11424 from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the
11425 mouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his
11426 crooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it again
11427 and again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and
11428 again sent it into the whale.
11429 
11430 “Pull up—pull up!” he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale
11431 relaxed in his wrath. “Pull up!—close to!” and the boat ranged along
11432 the fish’s flank. When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned
11433 his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully
11434 churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold
11435 watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of
11436 breaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was
11437 the innermost life of the fish. And now it is struck; for, starting
11438 from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his “flurry,” the
11439 monster horribly wallowed in his blood, overwrapped himself in
11440 impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the imperilled craft,
11441 instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to struggle out from
11442 that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day.
11443 
11444 And now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into
11445 view; surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting
11446 his spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last,
11447 gush after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees
11448 of red wine, shot into the frighted air; and falling back again, ran
11449 dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea. His heart had burst!
11450 
11451 “He’s dead, Mr. Stubb,” said Daggoo.
11452 
11453 “Yes; both pipes smoked out!” and withdrawing his own from his mouth,
11454 Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood
11455 thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.
11456 
11457 
11458 CHAPTER 62. The Dart.
11459 
11460 A word concerning an incident in the last chapter.
11461 
11462 According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes
11463 off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary
11464 steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost
11465 oar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong,
11466 nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what
11467 is called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the
11468 distance of twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting
11469 the chase, the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the
11470 uttermost; indeed, he is expected to set an example of superhuman
11471 activity to the rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated
11472 loud and intrepid exclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the
11473 top of one’s compass, while all the other muscles are strained and half
11474 started—what that is none know but those who have tried it. For one, I
11475 cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same
11476 time. In this straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the
11477 fish, all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting
11478 cry—“Stand up, and give it to him!” He now has to drop and secure his
11479 oar, turn round on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the
11480 crotch, and with what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it
11481 somehow into the whale. No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen
11482 in a body, that out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are
11483 successful; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed
11484 and disrated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their
11485 blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are
11486 absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship
11487 owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer that
11488 makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can
11489 you expect to find it there when most wanted!
11490 
11491 Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,
11492 that is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer
11493 likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of
11494 themselves and every one else. It is then they change places; and the
11495 headsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his proper
11496 station in the bows of the boat.
11497 
11498 Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both
11499 foolish and unnecessary. The headsman should stay in the bows from
11500 first to last; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no
11501 rowing whatever should be expected of him, except under circumstances
11502 obvious to any fisherman. I know that this would sometimes involve a
11503 slight loss of speed in the chase; but long experience in various
11504 whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast
11505 majority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so
11506 much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the
11507 harpooneer that has caused them.
11508 
11509 To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this
11510 world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out
11511 of toil.
11512 
11513 
11514 CHAPTER 63. The Crotch.
11515 
11516 Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs. So, in
11517 productive subjects, grow the chapters.
11518 
11519 The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention.
11520 It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length,
11521 which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the
11522 bow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of
11523 the harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the
11524 prow. Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who
11525 snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his
11526 rifle from the wall. It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in
11527 the crotch, respectively called the first and second irons.
11528 
11529 But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with
11530 the line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one
11531 instantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the
11532 coming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It
11533 is a doubling of the chances. But it very often happens that owing to
11534 the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon
11535 receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer,
11536 however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into
11537 him. Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the
11538 line, and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events,
11539 be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else
11540 the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands. Tumbled into the
11541 water, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box line
11542 (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making this feat, in most instances,
11543 prudently practicable. But this critical act is not always unattended
11544 with the saddest and most fatal casualties.
11545 
11546 Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown
11547 overboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror,
11548 skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the lines,
11549 or cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all directions.
11550 Nor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until the whale is
11551 fairly captured and a corpse.
11552 
11553 Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging
11554 one unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these
11555 qualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of
11556 such an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be
11557 simultaneously dangling about him. For, of course, each boat is
11558 supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first
11559 one be ineffectually darted without recovery. All these particulars are
11560 faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to elucidate several
11561 most important, however intricate passages, in scenes hereafter to be
11562 painted.
11563 
11564 
11565 CHAPTER 64. Stubb’s Supper.
11566 
11567 Stubb’s whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was a
11568 calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow
11569 business of towing the trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen
11570 men with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and
11571 fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse
11572 in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long
11573 intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of
11574 the mass we moved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever
11575 they call it, in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will
11576 draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour; but this
11577 grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if laden with pig-lead
11578 in bulk.
11579 
11580 Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod’s
11581 main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab
11582 dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly
11583 eyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for
11584 securing it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman,
11585 went his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until
11586 morning.
11587 
11588 Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had
11589 evinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the
11590 creature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or
11591 despair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead body
11592 reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a thousand
11593 other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not one jot
11594 advance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon you would have thought
11595 from the sound on the Pequod’s decks, that all hands were preparing to
11596 cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the
11597 deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking
11598 links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. Tied by
11599 the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies
11600 with its black hull close to the vessel’s and seen through the darkness
11601 of the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the two—ship
11602 and whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one
11603 reclines while the other remains standing.*
11604 
11605 *A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most
11606 reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside,
11607 is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is
11608 relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its
11609 flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface;
11610 so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to
11611 put the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a
11612 small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end,
11613 and a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship.
11614 By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side
11615 of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily
11616 made to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last
11617 locked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of
11618 junction with its broad flukes or lobes.
11619 
11620 If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known
11621 on deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an
11622 unusual but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was
11623 he in that the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned
11624 to him for the time the sole management of affairs. One small, helping
11625 cause of all this liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely
11626 manifest. Stubb was a high liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond of
11627 the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate.
11628 
11629 “A steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut
11630 me one from his small!”
11631 
11632 Here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general
11633 thing, and according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray
11634 the current expenses of the war (at least before realizing the proceeds
11635 of the voyage), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers
11636 who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale
11637 designated by Stubb; comprising the tapering extremity of the body.
11638 
11639 About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two
11640 lanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper
11641 at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb
11642 the only banqueter on whale’s flesh that night. Mingling their
11643 mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks,
11644 swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness.
11645 The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp
11646 slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few inches of the
11647 sleepers’ hearts. Peering over the side you could just see them (as
11648 before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and
11649 turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of
11650 the whale of the bigness of a human head. This particular feat of the
11651 shark seems all but miraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable
11652 surface, they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains
11653 a part of the universal problem of all things. The mark they thus leave
11654 on the whale, may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in
11655 countersinking for a screw.
11656 
11657 Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks
11658 will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship’s decks, like hungry dogs
11659 round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every
11660 killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant
11661 butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other’s
11662 live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks,
11663 also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away
11664 under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you to turn the
11665 whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing,
11666 that is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties;
11667 and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships
11668 crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy
11669 in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be
11670 decently buried; and though one or two other like instances might be
11671 set down, touching the set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks do
11672 most socially congregate, and most hilariously feast; yet is there no
11673 conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless
11674 numbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm
11675 whale, moored by night to a whaleship at sea. If you have never seen
11676 that sight, then suspend your decision about the propriety of
11677 devil-worship, and the expediency of conciliating the devil.
11678 
11679 But, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was
11680 going on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of
11681 his own epicurean lips.
11682 
11683 “Cook, cook!—where’s that old Fleece?” he cried at length, widening his
11684 legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his supper;
11685 and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if stabbing
11686 with his lance; “cook, you cook!—sail this way, cook!”
11687 
11688 The old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously
11689 roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came
11690 shambling along from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was
11691 something the matter with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well
11692 scoured like his other pans; this old Fleece, as they called him, came
11693 shuffling and limping along, assisting his step with his tongs, which,
11694 after a clumsy fashion, were made of straightened iron hoops; this old
11695 Ebony floundered along, and in obedience to the word of command, came
11696 to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb’s sideboard; when, with
11697 both hands folded before him, and resting on his two-legged cane, he
11698 bowed his arched back still further over, at the same time sideways
11699 inclining his head, so as to bring his best ear into play.
11700 
11701 “Cook,” said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his
11702 mouth, “don’t you think this steak is rather overdone? You’ve been
11703 beating this steak too much, cook; it’s too tender. Don’t I always say
11704 that to be good, a whale-steak must be tough? There are those sharks
11705 now over the side, don’t you see they prefer it tough and rare? What a
11706 shindy they are kicking up! Cook, go and talk to ’em; tell ’em they are
11707 welcome to help themselves civilly, and in moderation, but they must
11708 keep quiet. Blast me, if I can hear my own voice. Away, cook, and
11709 deliver my message. Here, take this lantern,” snatching one from his
11710 sideboard; “now then, go and preach to ’em!”
11711 
11712 Sullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the deck
11713 to the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low over
11714 the sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the other
11715 hand he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the side in
11716 a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks, while Stubb, softly
11717 crawling behind, overheard all that was said.
11718 
11719 “Fellow-critters: I’se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam
11720 noise dare. You hear? Stop dat dam smackin’ ob de lip! Massa Stubb say
11721 dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings, but by Gor! you
11722 must stop dat dam racket!”
11723 
11724 “Cook,” here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with a sudden slap
11725 on the shoulder,—“Cook! why, damn your eyes, you mustn’t swear that way
11726 when you’re preaching. That’s no way to convert sinners, cook!”
11727 
11728 “Who dat? Den preach to him yourself,” sullenly turning to go.
11729 
11730 “No, cook; go on, go on.”
11731 
11732 “Well, den, Belubed fellow-critters:”—
11733 
11734 “Right!” exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, “coax ’em to it; try that,” and
11735 Fleece continued.
11736 
11737 “Do you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you,
11738 fellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness—’top dat dam slappin’ ob de
11739 tail! How you tink to hear, spose you keep up such a dam slappin’ and
11740 bitin’ dare?”
11741 
11742 “Cook,” cried Stubb, collaring him, “I won’t have that swearing. Talk
11743 to ’em gentlemanly.”
11744 
11745 Once more the sermon proceeded.
11746 
11747 “Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don’t blame ye so much for; dat
11748 is natur, and can’t be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur, dat is
11749 de pint. You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in you, why
11750 den you be angel; for all angel is not’ing more dan de shark well
11751 goberned. Now, look here, bred’ren, just try wonst to be cibil, a
11752 helping yourselbs from dat whale. Don’t be tearin’ de blubber out your
11753 neighbour’s mout, I say. Is not one shark dood right as toder to dat
11754 whale? And, by Gor, none on you has de right to dat whale; dat whale
11755 belong to some one else. I know some o’ you has berry brig mout,
11756 brigger dan oders; but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small
11757 bellies; so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid, but to
11758 bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks, dat can’t get into de
11759 scrouge to help demselves.”
11760 
11761 “Well done, old Fleece!” cried Stubb, “that’s Christianity; go on.”
11762 
11763 “No use goin’ on; de dam willains will keep a scougin’ and slappin’
11764 each oder, Massa Stubb; dey don’t hear one word; no use a-preachin’ to
11765 such dam g’uttons as you call ’em, till dare bellies is full, and dare
11766 bellies is bottomless; and when dey do get ’em full, dey wont hear you
11767 den; for den dey sink in de sea, go fast to sleep on de coral, and
11768 can’t hear not’ing at all, no more, for eber and eber.”
11769 
11770 “Upon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give the benediction,
11771 Fleece, and I’ll away to my supper.”
11772 
11773 Upon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his
11774 shrill voice, and cried—
11775 
11776 “Cussed fellow-critters! Kick up de damndest row as ever you can; fill
11777 your dam’ bellies ’till dey bust—and den die.”
11778 
11779 “Now, cook,” said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan; “stand
11780 just where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay particular
11781 attention.”
11782 
11783 “All dention,” said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in the
11784 desired position.
11785 
11786 “Well,” said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; “I shall now go
11787 back to the subject of this steak. In the first place, how old are you,
11788 cook?”
11789 
11790 “What dat do wid de ’teak,” said the old black, testily.
11791 
11792 “Silence! How old are you, cook?”
11793 
11794 “’Bout ninety, dey say,” he gloomily muttered.
11795 
11796 “And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook,
11797 and don’t know yet how to cook a whale-steak?” rapidly bolting another
11798 mouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a continuation of the
11799 question. “Where were you born, cook?”
11800 
11801 “’Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin’ ober de Roanoke.”
11802 
11803 “Born in a ferry-boat! That’s queer, too. But I want to know what
11804 country you were born in, cook!”
11805 
11806 “Didn’t I say de Roanoke country?” he cried sharply.
11807 
11808 “No, you didn’t, cook; but I’ll tell you what I’m coming to, cook. You
11809 must go home and be born over again; you don’t know how to cook a
11810 whale-steak yet.”
11811 
11812 “Bress my soul, if I cook noder one,” he growled, angrily, turning
11813 round to depart.
11814 
11815 “Come back, cook;—here, hand me those tongs;—now take that bit of steak
11816 there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be? Take
11817 it, I say”—holding the tongs towards him—“take it, and taste it.”
11818 
11819 Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old negro
11820 muttered, “Best cooked ’teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy.”
11821 
11822 “Cook,” said Stubb, squaring himself once more; “do you belong to the
11823 church?”
11824 
11825 “Passed one once in Cape-Down,” said the old man sullenly.
11826 
11827 “And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town,
11828 where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as
11829 his beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook! And yet you come here,
11830 and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?” said Stubb.
11831 “Where do you expect to go to, cook?”
11832 
11833 “Go to bed berry soon,” he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.
11834 
11835 “Avast! heave to! I mean when you die, cook. It’s an awful question.
11836 Now what’s your answer?”
11837 
11838 “When dis old brack man dies,” said the negro slowly, changing his
11839 whole air and demeanor, “he hisself won’t go nowhere; but some bressed
11840 angel will come and fetch him.”
11841 
11842 “Fetch him? How? In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah? And fetch
11843 him where?”
11844 
11845 “Up dere,” said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and
11846 keeping it there very solemnly.
11847 
11848 “So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when
11849 you are dead? But don’t you know the higher you climb, the colder it
11850 gets? Main-top, eh?”
11851 
11852 “Didn’t say dat t’all,” said Fleece, again in the sulks.
11853 
11854 “You said up there, didn’t you? and now look yourself, and see where
11855 your tongs are pointing. But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven by
11856 crawling through the lubber’s hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you don’t
11857 get there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging. It’s a
11858 ticklish business, but must be done, or else it’s no go. But none of us
11859 are in heaven yet. Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my orders. Do ye
11860 hear? Hold your hat in one hand, and clap t’other a’top of your heart,
11861 when I’m giving my orders, cook. What! that your heart, there?—that’s
11862 your gizzard! Aloft! aloft!—that’s it—now you have it. Hold it there
11863 now, and pay attention.”
11864 
11865 “All ’dention,” said the old black, with both hands placed as desired,
11866 vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears in front at
11867 one and the same time.
11868 
11869 “Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad,
11870 that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that,
11871 don’t you? Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak for
11872 my private table here, the capstan, I’ll tell you what to do so as not
11873 to spoil it by overdoing. Hold the steak in one hand, and show a live
11874 coal to it with the other; that done, dish it; d’ye hear? And now
11875 to-morrow, cook, when we are cutting in the fish, be sure you stand by
11876 to get the tips of his fins; have them put in pickle. As for the ends
11877 of the flukes, have them soused, cook. There, now ye may go.”
11878 
11879 But Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.
11880 
11881 “Cook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch.
11882 D’ye hear? away you sail, then.—Halloa! stop! make a bow before you
11883 go.—Avast heaving again! Whale-balls for breakfast—don’t forget.”
11884 
11885 “Wish, by gor! whale eat him, ’stead of him eat whale. I’m bressed if
11886 he ain’t more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself,” muttered the old man,
11887 limping away; with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock.
11888 
11889 
11890 CHAPTER 65. The Whale as a Dish.
11891 
11892 That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and,
11893 like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems so
11894 outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and
11895 philosophy of it.
11896 
11897 It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right
11898 Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large
11899 prices there. Also, that in Henry VIIIth’s time, a certain cook of the
11900 court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be
11901 eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of
11902 whale. Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The
11903 meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being
11904 well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls.
11905 The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a great
11906 porpoise grant from the crown.
11907 
11908 The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all
11909 hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but
11910 when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet
11911 long, it takes away your appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men
11912 like Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are
11913 not so fastidious. We all know how they live upon whales, and have rare
11914 old vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous
11915 doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly
11916 juicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who
11917 long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel—that
11918 these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of
11919 whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among
11920 the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called “fritters”; which, indeed,
11921 they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something
11922 like old Amsterdam housewives’ dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh.
11923 They have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can
11924 hardly keep his hands off.
11925 
11926 But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his
11927 exceeding richness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be
11928 delicately good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the
11929 buffalo’s (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid
11930 pyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that
11931 is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the
11932 third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for
11933 butter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into
11934 some other substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try watches
11935 of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their
11936 ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many
11937 a good supper have I thus made.
11938 
11939 In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine
11940 dish. The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two
11941 plump, whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large
11942 puddings), they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most
11943 delectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves’ head, which is
11944 quite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows that some young
11945 bucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon calves’ brains, by
11946 and by get to have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to
11947 tell a calf’s head from their own heads; which, indeed, requires
11948 uncommon discrimination. And that is the reason why a young buck with
11949 an intelligent looking calf’s head before him, is somehow one of the
11950 saddest sights you can see. The head looks a sort of reproachfully at
11951 him, with an “Et tu Brute!” expression.
11952 
11953 It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively
11954 unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with
11955 abhorrence; that appears to result, in some way, from the consideration
11956 before mentioned: _i.e._ that a man should eat a newly murdered thing
11957 of the sea, and eat it too by its own light. But no doubt the first man
11958 that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was
11959 hung; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly would
11960 have been; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does. Go to the
11961 meat-market of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds
11962 staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds. Does not that sight
11963 take a tooth out of the cannibal’s jaw? Cannibals? who is not a
11964 cannibal? I tell you it will be more tolerable for the Fejee that
11965 salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine; it
11966 will be more tolerable for that provident Fejee, I say, in the day of
11967 judgment, than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand, who
11968 nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy
11969 paté-de-foie-gras.
11970 
11971 But Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is
11972 adding insult to injury, is it? Look at your knife-handle, there, my
11973 civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what is
11974 that handle made of?—what but the bones of the brother of the very ox
11975 you are eating? And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring
11976 that fat goose? With a feather of the same fowl. And with what quill
11977 did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to
11978 Ganders formally indite his circulars? It is only within the last month
11979 or two that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but
11980 steel pens.
11981 
11982 
11983 CHAPTER 66. The Shark Massacre.
11984 
11985 When in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and
11986 weary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a general
11987 thing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting
11988 him in. For that business is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very
11989 soon completed; and requires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the
11990 common usage is to take in all sail; lash the helm a’lee; and then send
11991 every one below to his hammock till daylight, with the reservation
11992 that, until that time, anchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and
11993 two for an hour, each couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck
11994 to see that all goes well.
11995 
11996 But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will
11997 not answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather
11998 round the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a
11999 stretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning. In
12000 most other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so
12001 largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably
12002 diminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades, a
12003 procedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to
12004 tickle them into still greater activity. But it was not thus in the
12005 present case with the Pequod’s sharks; though, to be sure, any man
12006 unaccustomed to such sights, to have looked over her side that night,
12007 would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and
12008 those sharks the maggots in it.
12009 
12010 Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was
12011 concluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came
12012 on deck, no small excitement was created among the sharks; for
12013 immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side, and lowering
12014 three lanterns, so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid
12015 sea, these two mariners, darting their long whaling-spades, kept up an
12016 incessant murdering of the sharks,* by striking the keen steel deep
12017 into their skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But in the foamy
12018 confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not
12019 always hit their mark; and this brought about new revelations of the
12020 incredible ferocity of the foe. They viciously snapped, not only at
12021 each other’s disembowelments, but like flexible bows, bent round, and
12022 bit their own; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again
12023 by the same mouth, to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound. Nor was
12024 this all. It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these
12025 creatures. A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in
12026 their very joints and bones, after what might be called the individual
12027 life had departed. Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin,
12028 one of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg’s hand off, when he tried
12029 to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw.
12030 
12031 *The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel;
12032 is about the bigness of a man’s spread hand; and in general shape,
12033 corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only its
12034 sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than
12035 the lower. This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible; and when
12036 being used is occasionally honed, just like a razor. In its socket, a
12037 stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted for a handle.
12038 
12039 “Queequeg no care what god made him shark,” said the savage,
12040 agonizingly lifting his hand up and down; “wedder Fejee god or
12041 Nantucket god; but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin.”
12042 
12043 
12044 CHAPTER 67. Cutting In.
12045 
12046 It was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio
12047 professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen. The ivory Pequod was
12048 turned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher. You would
12049 have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.
12050 
12051 In the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous
12052 things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and
12053 which no single man can possibly lift—this vast bunch of grapes was
12054 swayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the
12055 strongest point anywhere above a ship’s deck. The end of the
12056 hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then conducted
12057 to the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over
12058 the whale; to this block the great blubber hook, weighing some one
12059 hundred pounds, was attached. And now suspended in stages over the
12060 side, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their long spades,
12061 began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just
12062 above the nearest of the two side-fins. This done, a broad,
12063 semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted, and the
12064 main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence heaving
12065 in one dense crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the entire ship
12066 careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the nail-heads
12067 of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and nods her
12068 frighted mast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans over to the
12069 whale, while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a
12070 helping heave from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap
12071 is heard; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from
12072 the whale, and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it
12073 the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber. Now as
12074 the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange,
12075 so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes
12076 stripped by spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept up by the
12077 windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the
12078 water, and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the
12079 line called the “scarf,” simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck
12080 and Stubb, the mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and
12081 indeed by that very act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher
12082 and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the
12083 windlass then cease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious
12084 blood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and
12085 every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else
12086 it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.
12087 
12088 One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon
12089 called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices
12090 out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into
12091 this hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then
12092 hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for
12093 what follows. Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands
12094 to stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a
12095 few sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in
12096 twain; so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper
12097 strip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for
12098 lowering. The heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one
12099 tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other
12100 is slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the
12101 main hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the
12102 blubber-room. Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep
12103 coiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of
12104 plaited serpents. And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting
12105 and lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the
12106 heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates
12107 scarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by
12108 way of assuaging the general friction.
12109 
12110 
12111 CHAPTER 68. The Blanket.
12112 
12113 I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin
12114 of the whale. I have had controversies about it with experienced
12115 whalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore. My original opinion
12116 remains unchanged; but it is only an opinion.
12117 
12118 The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already you
12119 know what his blubber is. That blubber is something of the consistence
12120 of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and
12121 ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness.
12122 
12123 Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any
12124 creature’s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet
12125 in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption;
12126 because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the
12127 whale’s body but that same blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer
12128 of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin?
12129 True, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with
12130 your hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat
12131 resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as
12132 flexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to being dried, when it
12133 not only contracts and thickens, but becomes rather hard and brittle. I
12134 have several such dried bits, which I use for marks in my whale-books.
12135 It is transparent, as I said before; and being laid upon the printed
12136 page, I have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a
12137 magnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant to read about whales
12138 through their own spectacles, as you may say. But what I am driving at
12139 here is this. That same infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I
12140 admit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so much to be
12141 regarded as the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to
12142 speak; for it were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of
12143 the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a
12144 new-born child. But no more of this.
12145 
12146 Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin,
12147 as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one
12148 hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity,
12149 or rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three
12150 fourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence
12151 be had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose
12152 mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that. Reckoning ten
12153 barrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three
12154 quarters of the stuff of the whale’s skin.
12155 
12156 In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among
12157 the many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over
12158 obliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in
12159 thick array, something like those in the finest Italian line
12160 engravings. But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the
12161 isinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as
12162 if they were engraved upon the body itself. Nor is this all. In some
12163 instances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a
12164 veritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other delineations.
12165 These are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers
12166 on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to
12167 use in the present connexion. By my retentive memory of the
12168 hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was much struck
12169 with a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the
12170 famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi.
12171 Like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale remains
12172 undecipherable. This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another
12173 thing. Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm
12174 Whale presents, he not seldom displays the back, and more especially
12175 his flanks, effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by
12176 reason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random
12177 aspect. I should say that those New England rocks on the sea-coast,
12178 which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact
12179 with vast floating icebergs—I should say, that those rocks must not a
12180 little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also seems to me
12181 that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact
12182 with other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large,
12183 full-grown bulls of the species.
12184 
12185 A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the
12186 whale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long
12187 pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very
12188 happy and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber
12189 as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho
12190 slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of
12191 this cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep
12192 himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides.
12193 What would become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy
12194 seas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other
12195 fish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but
12196 these, be it observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very
12197 bellies are refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the
12198 lee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn
12199 fire; whereas, like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his
12200 blood, and he dies. How wonderful is it then—except after
12201 explanation—that this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as
12202 indispensable as it is to man; how wonderful that he should be found at
12203 home, immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when
12204 seamen fall overboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards,
12205 perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is
12206 found glued in amber. But more surprising is it to know, as has been
12207 proved by experiment, that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than
12208 that of a Borneo negro in summer.
12209 
12210 It does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong
12211 individual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare
12212 virtue of interior spaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself
12213 after the whale! Do thou, too, remain warm among ice. Do thou, too,
12214 live in this world without being of it. Be cool at the equator; keep
12215 thy blood fluid at the Pole. Like the great dome of St. Peter’s, and
12216 like the great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of
12217 thine own.
12218 
12219 But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things! Of erections,
12220 how few are domed like St. Peter’s! of creatures, how few vast as the
12221 whale!
12222 
12223 
12224 CHAPTER 69. The Funeral.
12225 
12226 “Haul in the chains! Let the carcase go astern!”
12227 
12228 The vast tackles have now done their duty. The peeled white body of the
12229 beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in hue,
12230 it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk. It is still colossal.
12231 Slowly it floats more and more away, the water round it torn and
12232 splashed by the insatiate sharks, and the air above vexed with
12233 rapacious flights of screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so many
12234 insulting poniards in the whale. The vast white headless phantom floats
12235 further and further from the ship, and every rod that it so floats,
12236 what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls, augment the
12237 murderous din. For hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that
12238 hideous sight is seen. Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky, upon
12239 the fair face of the pleasant sea, wafted by the joyous breezes, that
12240 great mass of death floats on and on, till lost in infinite
12241 perspectives.
12242 
12243 There’s a most doleful and most mocking funeral! The sea-vultures all
12244 in pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or
12245 speckled. In life but few of them would have helped the whale, I ween,
12246 if peradventure he had needed it; but upon the banquet of his funeral
12247 they most piously do pounce. Oh, horrible vultureism of earth! from
12248 which not the mightiest whale is free.
12249 
12250 Nor is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost
12251 survives and hovers over it to scare. Espied by some timid man-of-war
12252 or blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring
12253 the swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in
12254 the sun, and the white spray heaving high against it; straightway the
12255 whale’s unharming corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the
12256 log—_shoals, rocks, and breakers hereabouts: beware!_ And for years
12257 afterwards, perhaps, ships shun the place; leaping over it as silly
12258 sheep leap over a vacuum, because their leader originally leaped there
12259 when a stick was held. There’s your law of precedents; there’s your
12260 utility of traditions; there’s the story of your obstinate survival of
12261 old beliefs never bottomed on the earth, and now not even hovering in
12262 the air! There’s orthodoxy!
12263 
12264 Thus, while in life the great whale’s body may have been a real terror
12265 to his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a
12266 world.
12267 
12268 Are you a believer in ghosts, my friend? There are other ghosts than
12269 the Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe
12270 in them.
12271 
12272 
12273 CHAPTER 70. The Sphynx.
12274 
12275 It should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping
12276 the body of the leviathan, he was beheaded. Now, the beheading of the
12277 Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced
12278 whale surgeons very much pride themselves: and not without reason.
12279 
12280 Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck;
12281 on the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that
12282 very place, is the thickest part of him. Remember, also, that the
12283 surgeon must operate from above, some eight or ten feet intervening
12284 between him and his subject, and that subject almost hidden in a
12285 discoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea. Bear
12286 in mind, too, that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut
12287 many feet deep in the flesh; and in that subterraneous manner, without
12288 so much as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus
12289 made, he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts,
12290 and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion
12291 into the skull. Do you not marvel, then, at Stubb’s boast, that he
12292 demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale?
12293 
12294 When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a
12295 cable till the body is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small
12296 whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a
12297 full grown leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale’s head
12298 embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to suspend
12299 such a burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a whaler, this
12300 were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers’
12301 scales.
12302 
12303 The Pequod’s whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head
12304 was hoisted against the ship’s side—about half way out of the sea, so
12305 that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element. And
12306 there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it, by reason of
12307 the enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm
12308 on that side projecting like a crane over the waves; there, that
12309 blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod’s waist like the giant
12310 Holofernes’s from the girdle of Judith.
12311 
12312 When this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went
12313 below to their dinner. Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but
12314 now deserted deck. An intense copper calm, like a universal yellow
12315 lotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves
12316 upon the sea.
12317 
12318 A short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone
12319 from his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to
12320 gaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took
12321 Stubb’s long spade—still remaining there after the whale’s
12322 decapitation—and striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended
12323 mass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm, and so stood
12324 leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.
12325 
12326 It was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so
12327 intense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx’s in the desert. “Speak, thou vast
12328 and venerable head,” muttered Ahab, “which, though ungarnished with a
12329 beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty
12330 head, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee. Of all divers, thou
12331 hast dived the deepest. That head upon which the upper sun now gleams,
12332 has moved amid this world’s foundations. Where unrecorded names and
12333 navies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous
12334 hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the
12335 drowned; there, in that awful water-land, there was thy most familiar
12336 home. Thou hast been where bell or diver never went; hast slept by many
12337 a sailor’s side, where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay
12338 them down. Thou saw’st the locked lovers when leaping from their
12339 flaming ship; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave; true
12340 to each other, when heaven seemed false to them. Thou saw’st the
12341 murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck; for hours
12342 he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw; and his
12343 murderers still sailed on unharmed—while swift lightnings shivered the
12344 neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to
12345 outstretched, longing arms. O head! thou hast seen enough to split the
12346 planets and make an infidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!”
12347 
12348 “Sail ho!” cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.
12349 
12350 “Aye? Well, now, that’s cheering,” cried Ahab, suddenly erecting
12351 himself, while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow. “That
12352 lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better
12353 man.—Where away?”
12354 
12355 “Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze
12356 to us!
12357 
12358 “Better and better, man. Would now St. Paul would come along that way,
12359 and to my breezelessness bring his breeze! O Nature, and O soul of man!
12360 how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not the
12361 smallest atom stirs or lives on matter, but has its cunning duplicate
12362 in mind.”
12363 
12364 
12365 CHAPTER 71. The Jeroboam’s Story.
12366 
12367 Hand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster than
12368 the ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.
12369 
12370 By and by, through the glass the stranger’s boats and manned mast-heads
12371 proved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far to windward, and
12372 shooting by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the
12373 Pequod could not hope to reach her. So the signal was set to see what
12374 response would be made.
12375 
12376 Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships
12377 of the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which
12378 signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective
12379 vessels attached, every captain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale
12380 commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean, even at
12381 considerable distances and with no small facility.
12382 
12383 The Pequod’s signal was at last responded to by the stranger’s setting
12384 her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket.
12385 Squaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod’s lee,
12386 and lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was
12387 being rigged by Starbuck’s order to accommodate the visiting captain,
12388 the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat’s stern in token
12389 of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary. It turned out that the
12390 Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her
12391 captain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod’s company. For, though
12392 himself and boat’s crew remained untainted, and though his ship was
12393 half a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and
12394 flowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine
12395 of the land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with
12396 the Pequod.
12397 
12398 But this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an
12399 interval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboam’s
12400 boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to
12401 the Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by this time it
12402 blew very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times
12403 by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed
12404 some way ahead; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper
12405 bearings again. Subject to this, and other the like interruptions now
12406 and then, a conversation was sustained between the two parties; but at
12407 intervals not without still another interruption of a very different
12408 sort.
12409 
12410 Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam’s boat, was a man of a singular
12411 appearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual
12412 notabilities make up all totalities. He was a small, short, youngish
12413 man, sprinkled all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant
12414 yellow hair. A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut
12415 tinge enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on
12416 his wrists. A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.
12417 
12418 So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had
12419 exclaimed—“That’s he! that’s he!—the long-togged scaramouch the
12420 Town-Ho’s company told us of!” Stubb here alluded to a strange story
12421 told of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some time
12422 previous when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho. According to this account
12423 and what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the scaramouch in
12424 question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the
12425 Jeroboam. His story was this:
12426 
12427 He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna
12428 Shakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret
12429 meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a
12430 trap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which he
12431 carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing
12432 gunpowder, was supposed to be charged with laudanum. A strange,
12433 apostolic whim having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket,
12434 where, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady,
12435 common-sense exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand candidate
12436 for the Jeroboam’s whaling voyage. They engaged him; but straightway
12437 upon the ship’s getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in
12438 a freshet. He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded
12439 the captain to jump overboard. He published his manifesto, whereby he
12440 set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and
12441 vicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching earnestness with which
12442 he declared these things;—the dark, daring play of his sleepless,
12443 excited imagination, and all the preternatural terrors of real
12444 delirium, united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of
12445 the ignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness. Moreover, they
12446 were afraid of him. As such a man, however, was not of much practical
12447 use in the ship, especially as he refused to work except when he
12448 pleased, the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him; but
12449 apprised that that individual’s intention was to land him in the first
12450 convenient port, the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and
12451 vials—devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in
12452 case this intention was carried out. So strongly did he work upon his
12453 disciples among the crew, that at last in a body they went to the
12454 captain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of
12455 them would remain. He was therefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor
12456 would they permit Gabriel to be any way maltreated, say or do what he
12457 would; so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of
12458 the ship. The consequence of all this was, that the archangel cared
12459 little or nothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had
12460 broken out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the
12461 plague, as he called it, was at his sole command; nor should it be
12462 stayed but according to his good pleasure. The sailors, mostly poor
12463 devils, cringed, and some of them fawned before him; in obedience to
12464 his instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god.
12465 Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are true.
12466 Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the
12467 measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless
12468 power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But it is time to
12469 return to the Pequod.
12470 
12471 “I fear not thy epidemic, man,” said Ahab from the bulwarks, to Captain
12472 Mayhew, who stood in the boat’s stern; “come on board.”
12473 
12474 But now Gabriel started to his feet.
12475 
12476 “Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious! Beware of the horrible
12477 plague!”
12478 
12479 “Gabriel! Gabriel!” cried Captain Mayhew; “thou must either—” But that
12480 instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its seethings
12481 drowned all speech.
12482 
12483 “Hast thou seen the White Whale?” demanded Ahab, when the boat drifted
12484 back.
12485 
12486 “Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk! Beware of the
12487 horrible tail!”
12488 
12489 “I tell thee again, Gabriel, that—” But again the boat tore ahead as if
12490 dragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a
12491 succession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional
12492 caprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the
12493 hoisted sperm whale’s head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was
12494 seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel
12495 nature seemed to warrant.
12496 
12497 When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story
12498 concerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from
12499 Gabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed
12500 leagued with him.
12501 
12502 It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking
12503 a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of
12504 Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this
12505 intelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the
12506 White Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering
12507 insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the
12508 Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some
12509 year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the
12510 mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter him;
12511 and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the
12512 opportunity, despite all the archangel’s denunciations and
12513 forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.
12514 With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many
12515 perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one iron
12516 fast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was
12517 tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of
12518 speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while
12519 Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat’s bow, and with all the
12520 reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the
12521 whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a
12522 broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning motion,
12523 temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen. Next
12524 instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious life, was smitten bodily
12525 into the air, and making a long arc in his descent, fell into the sea
12526 at the distance of about fifty yards. Not a chip of the boat was
12527 harmed, nor a hair of any oarsman’s head; but the mate for ever sank.
12528 
12529 It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the
12530 Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.
12531 Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;
12532 oftener the boat’s bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which the
12533 headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body. But
12534 strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one,
12535 when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is
12536 discernible; the man being stark dead.
12537 
12538 The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly
12539 descried from the ship. Raising a piercing shriek—“The vial! the vial!”
12540 Gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of
12541 the whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with added
12542 influence; because his credulous disciples believed that he had
12543 specifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a general
12544 prophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one
12545 of many marks in the wide margin allowed. He became a nameless terror
12546 to the ship.
12547 
12548 Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to him,
12549 that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he
12550 intended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which
12551 Ahab answered—“Aye.” Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started to
12552 his feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with
12553 downward pointed finger—“Think, think of the blasphemer—dead, and down
12554 there!—beware of the blasphemer’s end!”
12555 
12556 Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, “Captain, I have just
12557 bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy
12558 officers, if I mistake not. Starbuck, look over the bag.”
12559 
12560 Every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various
12561 ships, whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed,
12562 depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans.
12563 Thus, most letters never reach their mark; and many are only received
12564 after attaining an age of two or three years or more.
12565 
12566 Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was sorely
12567 tumbled, damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in
12568 consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin. Of such a
12569 letter, Death himself might well have been the post-boy.
12570 
12571 “Can’st not read it?” cried Ahab. “Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it’s but
12572 a dim scrawl;—what’s this?” As he was studying it out, Starbuck took a
12573 long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to
12574 insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without
12575 its coming any closer to the ship.
12576 
12577 Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, “Mr. Har—yes, Mr. Harry—(a
12578 woman’s pinny hand,—the man’s wife, I’ll wager)—Aye—Mr. Harry Macey,
12579 Ship Jeroboam;—why it’s Macey, and he’s dead!”
12580 
12581 “Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife,” sighed Mayhew; “but let
12582 me have it.”
12583 
12584 “Nay, keep it thyself,” cried Gabriel to Ahab; “thou art soon going
12585 that way.”
12586 
12587 “Curses throttle thee!” yelled Ahab. “Captain Mayhew, stand by now to
12588 receive it”; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck’s hands, he
12589 caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the
12590 boat. But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing;
12591 the boat drifted a little towards the ship’s stern; so that, as if by
12592 magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel’s eager hand. He
12593 clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the
12594 letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab’s
12595 feet. Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their
12596 oars, and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the
12597 Pequod.
12598 
12599 As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket
12600 of the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild
12601 affair.
12602 
12603 
12604 CHAPTER 72. The Monkey-Rope.
12605 
12606 In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale,
12607 there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands
12608 are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no
12609 staying in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has
12610 to be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the
12611 description of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was
12612 mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale’s back, the
12613 blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the
12614 spades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that
12615 same hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my
12616 particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to
12617 descend upon the monster’s back for the special purpose referred to.
12618 But in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall
12619 remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is
12620 concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged,
12621 excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten
12622 feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about,
12623 half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like
12624 a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured
12625 in the Highland costume—a shirt and socks—in which to my eyes, at
12626 least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better
12627 chance to observe him, as will presently be seen.
12628 
12629 Being the savage’s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar
12630 in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to
12631 attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead
12632 whale’s back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by
12633 a long cord. Just so, from the ship’s steep side, did I hold Queequeg
12634 down there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a
12635 monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his
12636 waist.
12637 
12638 It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we
12639 proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both
12640 ends; fast to Queequeg’s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow
12641 leather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time,
12642 were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both
12643 usage and honor demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should
12644 drag me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature
12645 united us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I
12646 any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond
12647 entailed.
12648 
12649 So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then,
12650 that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to
12651 perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock
12652 company of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that
12653 another’s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited
12654 disaster and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of
12655 interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have
12656 so gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering—while I jerked
12657 him now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten
12658 to jam him—still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of
12659 mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in
12660 most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a
12661 plurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your
12662 apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True,
12663 you may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these
12664 and the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg’s
12665 monkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I
12666 came very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do
12667 what I would, I only had the management of one end of it.*
12668 
12669 *The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod
12670 that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This
12671 improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man
12672 than Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest
12673 possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his
12674 monkey-rope holder.
12675 
12676 I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the
12677 whale and the ship—where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant
12678 rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy
12679 he was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the
12680 night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before
12681 pent blood which began to flow from the carcass—the rabid creatures
12682 swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.
12683 
12684 And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them
12685 aside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it
12686 not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise
12687 miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.
12688 
12689 Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a
12690 ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to
12691 them. Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then
12692 jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what
12693 seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark—he was provided with still another
12694 protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and
12695 Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen
12696 whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could
12697 reach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and
12698 benevolent of them. They meant Queequeg’s best happiness, I admit; but
12699 in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that
12700 both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled
12701 water, those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a
12702 leg than a tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping
12703 there with that great iron hook—poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed
12704 to his Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.
12705 
12706 Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in
12707 and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea—what matters
12708 it, after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men
12709 in this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those
12710 sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks
12711 and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.
12712 
12713 But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now,
12714 as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last
12715 climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily
12716 trembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent,
12717 consolatory glance hands him—what? Some hot Cognac? No! hands him, ye
12718 gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!
12719 
12720 “Ginger? Do I smell ginger?” suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near.
12721 “Yes, this must be ginger,” peering into the as yet untasted cup. Then
12722 standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the
12723 astonished steward slowly saying, “Ginger? ginger? and will you have
12724 the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of
12725 ginger? Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to
12726 kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal? Ginger!—what the devil is
12727 ginger? Sea-coal? firewood?—lucifer matches?—tinder?—gunpowder?—what
12728 the devil is ginger, I say, that you offer this cup to our poor
12729 Queequeg here.”
12730 
12731 “There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this
12732 business,” he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just
12733 come from forward. “Will you look at that kannakin, sir: smell of it,
12734 if you please.” Then watching the mate’s countenance, he added, “The
12735 steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to
12736 Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale. Is the steward an
12737 apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by
12738 which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?”
12739 
12740 “I trust not,” said Starbuck, “it is poor stuff enough.”
12741 
12742 “Aye, aye, steward,” cried Stubb, “we’ll teach you to drug a
12743 harpooneer; none of your apothecary’s medicine here; you want to poison
12744 us, do ye? You have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder
12745 us all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?”
12746 
12747 “It was not me,” cried Dough-Boy, “it was Aunt Charity that brought the
12748 ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits,
12749 but only this ginger-jub—so she called it.”
12750 
12751 “Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to
12752 the lockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr.
12753 Starbuck. It is the captain’s orders—grog for the harpooneer on a
12754 whale.”
12755 
12756 “Enough,” replied Starbuck, “only don’t hit him again, but—”
12757 
12758 “Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of
12759 that sort; and this fellow’s a weazel. What were you about saying,
12760 sir?”
12761 
12762 “Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.”
12763 
12764 When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a
12765 sort of tea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong spirits, and
12766 was handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity’s gift, and that
12767 was freely given to the waves.
12768 
12769 
12770 CHAPTER 73. Stubb and Flask kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk
12771 over Him.
12772 
12773 It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale’s
12774 prodigious head hanging to the Pequod’s side. But we must let it
12775 continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to
12776 it. For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now for
12777 the head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.
12778 
12779 Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually
12780 drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,
12781 gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the
12782 Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking
12783 anywhere near. And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of
12784 those inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to
12785 cruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near
12786 the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had
12787 been brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the
12788 announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day,
12789 if opportunity offered.
12790 
12791 Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two
12792 boats, Stubb’s and Flask’s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further
12793 and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at
12794 the mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of
12795 tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or
12796 both the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in
12797 plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the
12798 towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at first
12799 it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a
12800 maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from
12801 view, as if diving under the keel. “Cut, cut!” was the cry from the
12802 ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being
12803 brought with a deadly dash against the vessel’s side. But having plenty
12804 of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they
12805 paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their
12806 might so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle
12807 was intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the tightened
12808 line in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the
12809 contending strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a few
12810 feet advance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did
12811 gain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning
12812 along the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship,
12813 suddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so
12814 flinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken
12815 glass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once
12816 more the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed,
12817 and blindly altering his course, went round the stern of the ship
12818 towing the two boats after him, so that they performed a complete
12819 circuit.
12820 
12821 Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close
12822 flanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance;
12823 and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the
12824 multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale’s body,
12825 rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every
12826 new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains
12827 that poured from the smitten rock.
12828 
12829 At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he
12830 turned upon his back a corpse.
12831 
12832 While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes,
12833 and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some
12834 conversation ensued between them.
12835 
12836 “I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,” said
12837 Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so
12838 ignoble a leviathan.
12839 
12840 “Wants with it?” said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat’s bow,
12841 “did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale’s
12842 head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right
12843 Whale’s on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can
12844 never afterwards capsize?”
12845 
12846 “Why not?
12847 
12848 “I don’t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so,
12849 and he seems to know all about ships’ charms. But I sometimes think
12850 he’ll charm the ship to no good at last. I don’t half like that chap,
12851 Stubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved
12852 into a snake’s head, Stubb?”
12853 
12854 “Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a
12855 dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look
12856 down there, Flask”—pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both
12857 hands—“Aye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in
12858 disguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been
12859 stowed away on board ship? He’s the devil, I say. The reason why you
12860 don’t see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries
12861 it coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of
12862 it, he’s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots.”
12863 
12864 “He sleeps in his boots, don’t he? He hasn’t got any hammock; but I’ve
12865 seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.”
12866 
12867 “No doubt, and it’s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye
12868 see, in the eye of the rigging.”
12869 
12870 “What’s the old man have so much to do with him for?”
12871 
12872 “Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.”
12873 
12874 “Bargain?—about what?”
12875 
12876 “Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and
12877 the devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away
12878 his silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then
12879 he’ll surrender Moby Dick.”
12880 
12881 “Pooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?”
12882 
12883 “I don’t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked
12884 one, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old
12885 flag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and
12886 gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he
12887 was at home, and asked the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching
12888 his hoofs, up and says, ‘I want John.’ ‘What for?’ says the old
12889 governor. ‘What business is that of yours,’ says the devil, getting
12890 mad,—‘I want to use him.’ ‘Take him,’ says the governor—and by the
12891 Lord, Flask, if the devil didn’t give John the Asiatic cholera before
12892 he got through with him, I’ll eat this whale in one mouthful. But look
12893 sharp—ain’t you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let’s get
12894 the whale alongside.”
12895 
12896 “I think I remember some such story as you were telling,” said Flask,
12897 when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden
12898 towards the ship, “but I can’t remember where.”
12899 
12900 “Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes?
12901 Did ye read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?”
12902 
12903 “No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me,
12904 Stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was
12905 the same you say is now on board the Pequod?”
12906 
12907 “Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn’t the devil live
12908 for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see any
12909 parson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a
12910 latch-key to get into the admiral’s cabin, don’t you suppose he can
12911 crawl into a porthole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?”
12912 
12913 “How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?”
12914 
12915 “Do you see that mainmast there?” pointing to the ship; “well, that’s
12916 the figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod’s hold, and string
12917 along in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that
12918 wouldn’t begin to be Fedallah’s age. Nor all the coopers in creation
12919 couldn’t show hoops enough to make oughts enough.”
12920 
12921 “But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you
12922 meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if
12923 he’s so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going to
12924 live for ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboard—tell me
12925 that?
12926 
12927 “Give him a good ducking, anyhow.”
12928 
12929 “But he’d crawl back.”
12930 
12931 “Duck him again; and keep ducking him.”
12932 
12933 “Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though—yes, and
12934 drown you—what then?”
12935 
12936 “I should like to see him try it; I’d give him such a pair of black
12937 eyes that he wouldn’t dare to show his face in the admiral’s cabin
12938 again for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he
12939 lives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much. Damn
12940 the devil, Flask; so you suppose I’m afraid of the devil? Who’s afraid
12941 of him, except the old governor who daresn’t catch him and put him in
12942 double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping
12943 people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the people the devil
12944 kidnapped, he’d roast for him? There’s a governor!”
12945 
12946 “Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?”
12947 
12948 “Do I suppose it? You’ll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now
12949 to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious
12950 going on, I’ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say—Look
12951 here, Beelzebub, you don’t do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord
12952 I’ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan,
12953 and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come
12954 short off at the stump—do you see; and then, I rather guess when he
12955 finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he’ll sneak off without the
12956 poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.”
12957 
12958 “And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?”
12959 
12960 “Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;—what else?”
12961 
12962 “Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, Stubb?”
12963 
12964 “Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship.”
12965 
12966 The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side,
12967 where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for
12968 securing him.
12969 
12970 “Didn’t I tell you so?” said Flask; “yes, you’ll soon see this right
12971 whale’s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti’s.”
12972 
12973 In good time, Flask’s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply
12974 leaned over towards the sperm whale’s head, now, by the counterpoise of
12975 both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may
12976 well believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Locke’s head, you go
12977 over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant’s and you come
12978 back again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep
12979 trimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard,
12980 and then you will float light and right.
12981 
12982 In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the
12983 ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the
12984 case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut
12985 off whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed
12986 and hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to
12987 what is called the crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present
12988 case, had been done. The carcases of both whales had dropped astern;
12989 and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair
12990 of overburdening panniers.
12991 
12992 Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale’s head, and ever
12993 and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own
12994 hand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his
12995 shadow; while, if the Parsee’s shadow was there at all it seemed only
12996 to blend with, and lengthen Ahab’s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish
12997 speculations were bandied among them, concerning all these passing
12998 things.
12999 
13000 
13001 CHAPTER 74. The Sperm Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.
13002 
13003 Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us
13004 join them, and lay together our own.
13005 
13006 Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right
13007 Whale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales
13008 regularly hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two
13009 extremes of all the known varieties of the whale. As the external
13010 difference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a
13011 head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod’s side; and as we
13012 may freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the
13013 deck:—where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance to
13014 study practical cetology than here?
13015 
13016 In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between
13017 these heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a
13018 certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale’s which the Right
13019 Whale’s sadly lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale’s head.
13020 As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to
13021 him, in point of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this
13022 dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the
13023 summit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he
13024 is what the fishermen technically call a “grey-headed whale.”
13025 
13026 Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads—namely, the two
13027 most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of the
13028 head, and low down, near the angle of either whale’s jaw, if you
13029 narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would
13030 fancy to be a young colt’s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the
13031 magnitude of the head.
13032 
13033 Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale’s eyes, it is
13034 plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more
13035 than he can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale’s
13036 eyes corresponds to that of a man’s ears; and you may fancy, for
13037 yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects
13038 through your ears. You would find that you could only command some
13039 thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight;
13040 and about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking
13041 straight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not
13042 be able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from
13043 behind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the
13044 same time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes
13045 the front of a man—what, indeed, but his eyes?
13046 
13047 Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes
13048 are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to
13049 produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of
13050 the whale’s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of
13051 solid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating
13052 two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the
13053 impressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore,
13054 must see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct
13055 picture on that side; while all between must be profound darkness and
13056 nothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the
13057 world from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with
13058 the whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two
13059 distinct windows, but sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the
13060 whale’s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and
13061 to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.
13062 
13063 A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this
13064 visual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a
13065 hint. So long as a man’s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing
13066 is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing
13067 whatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one’s experience
13068 will teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of
13069 things at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and
13070 completely, to examine any two things—however large or however small—at
13071 one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side
13072 and touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two
13073 objects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in
13074 order to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to
13075 bear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary
13076 consciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in
13077 themselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more
13078 comprehensive, combining, and subtle than man’s, that he can at the
13079 same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on
13080 one side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he
13081 can, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able
13082 simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct
13083 problems in Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is there any
13084 incongruity in this comparison.
13085 
13086 It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the
13087 extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when
13088 beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer
13089 frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly
13090 proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their
13091 divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them.
13092 
13093 But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an
13094 entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads for
13095 hours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf
13096 whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so
13097 wondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With
13098 respect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed
13099 between the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has
13100 an external opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered
13101 over with a membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.
13102 
13103 Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the
13104 world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear
13105 which is smaller than a hare’s? But if his eyes were broad as the lens
13106 of Herschel’s great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of
13107 cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of
13108 hearing? Not at all.—Why then do you try to “enlarge” your mind?
13109 Subtilize it.
13110 
13111 Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant
13112 over the sperm whale’s head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending
13113 by a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not
13114 that the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we
13115 might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But
13116 let us hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are. What
13117 a really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling,
13118 lined, or rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as
13119 bridal satins.
13120 
13121 But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems
13122 like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one
13123 end, instead of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead,
13124 and expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such,
13125 alas! it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these
13126 spikes fall with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold,
13127 when fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there
13128 suspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging
13129 straight down at right-angles with his body, for all the world like a
13130 ship’s jib-boom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of
13131 sorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his
13132 jaw have relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a
13133 reproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon
13134 him.
13135 
13136 In most cases this lower jaw—being easily unhinged by a practised
13137 artist—is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting
13138 the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone
13139 with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles,
13140 including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips.
13141 
13142 With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an
13143 anchor; and when the proper time comes—some few days after the other
13144 work—Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished dentists,
13145 are set to drawing teeth. With a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg lances
13146 the gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle being
13147 rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag
13148 stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands. There are generally
13149 forty-two teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed;
13150 nor filled after our artificial fashion. The jaw is afterwards sawn
13151 into slabs, and piled away like joists for building houses.
13152 
13153 
13154 CHAPTER 75. The Right Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.
13155 
13156 Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right
13157 Whale’s head.
13158 
13159 As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale’s head may be compared to a
13160 Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly
13161 rounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whale’s head bears a rather
13162 inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred
13163 years ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a
13164 shoemaker’s last. And in this same last or shoe, that old woman of the
13165 nursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably be
13166 lodged, she and all her progeny.
13167 
13168 But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different
13169 aspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit
13170 and look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole
13171 head for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in
13172 its sounding-board. Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange,
13173 crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass—this green,
13174 barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the “crown,” and the
13175 Southern fishers the “bonnet” of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes
13176 solely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak,
13177 with a bird’s nest in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those
13178 live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost
13179 sure to occur to you; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the
13180 technical term “crown” also bestowed upon it; in which case you will
13181 take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a
13182 diademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put together for
13183 him in this marvellous manner. But if this whale be a king, he is a
13184 very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem. Look at that hanging lower
13185 lip! what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by
13186 carpenter’s measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a
13187 sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.
13188 
13189 A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped.
13190 The fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an
13191 important interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when
13192 earthquakes caused the beach to gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery
13193 threshold, we now slide into the mouth. Upon my word were I at
13194 Mackinaw, I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good
13195 Lord! is this the road that Jonah went? The roof is about twelve feet
13196 high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were a regular
13197 ridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present us
13198 with those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone,
13199 say three hundred on a side, which depending from the upper part of the
13200 head or crown bone, form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere
13201 been cursorily mentioned. The edges of these bones are fringed with
13202 hairy fibres, through which the Right Whale strains the water, and in
13203 whose intricacies he retains the small fish, when openmouthed he goes
13204 through the seas of brit in feeding time. In the central blinds of
13205 bone, as they stand in their natural order, there are certain curious
13206 marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen calculate the
13207 creature’s age, as the age of an oak by its circular rings. Though the
13208 certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable, yet it has the
13209 savor of analogical probability. At any rate, if we yield to it, we
13210 must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance
13211 will seem reasonable.
13212 
13213 In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies
13214 concerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous
13215 “whiskers” inside of the whale’s mouth;* another, “hogs’ bristles”; a
13216 third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:
13217 “There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his
13218 upper _chop_, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth.”
13219 
13220 *This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or
13221 rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the
13222 upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts
13223 impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn
13224 countenance.
13225 
13226 As every one knows, these same “hogs’ bristles,” “fins,” “whiskers,”
13227 “blinds,” or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and
13228 other stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has
13229 long been on the decline. It was in Queen Anne’s time that the bone was
13230 in its glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And as those
13231 ancient dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as
13232 you may say; even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we
13233 nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a
13234 tent spread over the same bone.
13235 
13236 But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and,
13237 standing in the Right Whale’s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all
13238 these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not
13239 think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its
13240 thousand pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest
13241 Turkey—the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the
13242 mouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting
13243 it on deck. This particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I
13244 should say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that
13245 amount of oil.
13246 
13247 Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started
13248 with—that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely
13249 different heads. To sum up, then: in the Right Whale’s there is no
13250 great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible
13251 of a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale’s. Nor in the Sperm Whale are
13252 there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely
13253 anything of a tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two external
13254 spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.
13255 
13256 Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet
13257 lie together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other
13258 will not be very long in following.
13259 
13260 Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale’s there? It is the same
13261 he died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now
13262 faded away. I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like
13263 placidity, born of a speculative indifference as to death. But mark the
13264 other head’s expression. See that amazing lower lip, pressed by
13265 accident against the vessel’s side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw.
13266 Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical
13267 resolution in facing death? This Right Whale I take to have been a
13268 Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in
13269 his latter years.
13270 
13271 
13272 CHAPTER 76. The Battering-Ram.
13273 
13274 Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale’s head, I would have you,
13275 as a sensible physiologist, simply—particularly remark its front
13276 aspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have you
13277 investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some
13278 unexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may
13279 be lodged there. Here is a vital point; for you must either
13280 satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever remain an
13281 infidel as to one of the most appalling, but not the less true events,
13282 perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history.
13283 
13284 You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale,
13285 the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the
13286 water; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes
13287 considerably backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long
13288 socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the
13289 mouth is entirely under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as
13290 though your own mouth were entirely under your chin. Moreover you
13291 observe that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he
13292 has—his spout hole—is on the top of his head; you observe that his eyes
13293 and ears are at the sides of his head, nearly one third of his entire
13294 length from the front. Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the
13295 front of the Sperm Whale’s head is a dead, blind wall, without a single
13296 organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are
13297 now to consider that only in the extreme, lower, backward sloping part
13298 of the front of the head, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and
13299 not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the
13300 full cranial development. So that this whole enormous boneless mass is
13301 as one wad. Finally, though, as will soon be revealed, its contents
13302 partly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you are now to be apprised
13303 of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that
13304 apparent effeminacy. In some previous place I have described to you how
13305 the blubber wraps the body of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange.
13306 Just so with the head; but with this difference: about the head this
13307 envelope, though not so thick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable
13308 by any man who has not handled it. The severest pointed harpoon, the
13309 sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds
13310 from it. It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved
13311 with horses’ hoofs. I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.
13312 
13313 Bethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen
13314 chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the
13315 sailors do? They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming
13316 contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold
13317 there a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and
13318 toughest of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which
13319 would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By
13320 itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at. But
13321 supplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as
13322 ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them,
13323 capable, at will, of distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale,
13324 as far as I know, has no such provision in him; considering, too, the
13325 otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head
13326 altogether beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated
13327 out of the water; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its
13328 envelope; considering the unique interior of his head; it has
13329 hypothetically occurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled
13330 honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and
13331 unsuspected connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to
13332 atmospheric distension and contraction. If this be so, fancy the
13333 irresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and
13334 destructive of all elements contributes.
13335 
13336 Now, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable
13337 wall, and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a
13338 mass of tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood
13339 is—by the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the smallest
13340 insect. So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the
13341 specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this
13342 expansive monster; when I shall show you some of his more
13343 inconsiderable braining feats; I trust you will have renounced all
13344 ignorant incredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though the
13345 Sperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed
13346 the Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your
13347 eye-brow. For unless you own the whale, you are but a provincial and
13348 sentimentalist in Truth. But clear Truth is a thing for salamander
13349 giants only to encounter; how small the chances for the provincials
13350 then? What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess’s veil
13351 at Lais?
13352 
13353 
13354 CHAPTER 77. The Great Heidelburgh Tun.
13355 
13356 Now comes the Baling of the Case. But to comprehend it aright, you must
13357 know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated
13358 upon.
13359 
13360 Regarding the Sperm Whale’s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an
13361 inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the lower
13362 is the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an
13363 unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the
13364 expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. At the middle of the
13365 forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two
13366 almost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal
13367 wall of a thick tendinous substance.
13368 
13369 *Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical
13370 mathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a
13371 solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the
13372 steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both
13373 sides.
13374 
13375 The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of
13376 oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand
13377 infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole
13378 extent. The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great
13379 Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is
13380 mystically carved in front, so the whale’s vast plaited forehead forms
13381 innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his
13382 wondrous tun. Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished
13383 with the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun
13384 of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily
13385 vintages; namely, the highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure,
13386 limpid, and odoriferous state. Nor is this precious substance found
13387 unalloyed in any other part of the creature. Though in life it remains
13388 perfectly fluid, yet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon
13389 begins to concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when
13390 the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water. A large whale’s
13391 case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from
13392 unavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and
13393 dribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish
13394 business of securing what you can.
13395 
13396 I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was
13397 coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not
13398 possibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like
13399 the lining of a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm
13400 Whale’s case.
13401 
13402 It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale
13403 embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since—as
13404 has been elsewhere set forth—the head embraces one third of the whole
13405 length of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet
13406 for a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the
13407 depth of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a
13408 ship’s side.
13409 
13410 As in decapitating the whale, the operator’s instrument is brought
13411 close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the
13412 spermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest
13413 a careless, untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly
13414 let out its invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the
13415 head, also, which is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in
13416 that position by the enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen
13417 combinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in that
13418 quarter.
13419 
13420 Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and—in
13421 this particular instance—almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm
13422 Whale’s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.
13423 
13424 
13425 CHAPTER 78. Cistern and Buckets.
13426 
13427 Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect
13428 posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, to the
13429 part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried
13430 with him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts,
13431 travelling through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that
13432 it hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it
13433 is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down
13434 the other part, the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he
13435 lands on the summit of the head. There—still high elevated above the
13436 rest of the company, to whom he vivaciously cries—he seems some Turkish
13437 Muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A
13438 short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches
13439 for the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business
13440 he proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,
13441 sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time
13442 this cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like
13443 a well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the
13444 other end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or
13445 three alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the
13446 Indian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole.
13447 Inserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the
13448 bucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the word
13449 to the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all bubbling like
13450 a dairy-maid’s pail of new milk. Carefully lowered from its height, the
13451 full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand, and quickly
13452 emptied into a large tub. Then remounting aloft, it again goes through
13453 the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the
13454 end, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper
13455 and deeper into the Tun, until some twenty feet of the pole have gone
13456 down.
13457 
13458 Now, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;
13459 several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once
13460 a queer accident happened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild
13461 Indian, was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his
13462 one-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head; or
13463 whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or
13464 whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so, without
13465 stating his particular reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling
13466 now; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came
13467 suckingly up—my God! poor Tashtego—like the twin reciprocating bucket
13468 in a veritable well, dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of
13469 Heidelburgh, and with a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of
13470 sight!
13471 
13472 “Man overboard!” cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first
13473 came to his senses. “Swing the bucket this way!” and putting one foot
13474 into it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip
13475 itself, the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost
13476 before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom. Meantime, there
13477 was a terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before
13478 lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea,
13479 as if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only
13480 the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous
13481 depth to which he had sunk.
13482 
13483 At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing
13484 the whip—which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles—a
13485 sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all,
13486 one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with a
13487 vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship
13488 reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook,
13489 upon which the entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be
13490 on the point of giving way; an event still more likely from the violent
13491 motions of the head.
13492 
13493 “Come down, come down!” yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand
13494 holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he
13495 would still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line,
13496 rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the
13497 buried harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.
13498 
13499 “In heaven’s name, man,” cried Stubb, “are you ramming home a cartridge
13500 there?—Avast! How will that help him; jamming that iron-bound bucket on
13501 top of his head? Avast, will ye!”
13502 
13503 “Stand clear of the tackle!” cried a voice like the bursting of a
13504 rocket.
13505 
13506 Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass
13507 dropped into the sea, like Niagara’s Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the
13508 suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering
13509 copper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging—now over the
13510 sailors’ heads, and now over the water—Daggoo, through a thick mist of
13511 spray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor,
13512 buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the
13513 sea! But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away, when a naked
13514 figure with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen
13515 hovering over the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my
13516 brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to the
13517 side, and every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment,
13518 and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands
13519 now jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little off from the
13520 ship.
13521 
13522 “Ha! ha!” cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch
13523 overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust
13524 upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust
13525 forth from the grass over a grave.
13526 
13527 “Both! both!—it is both!”—cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout; and
13528 soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand, and
13529 with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into the
13530 waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was
13531 long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.
13532 
13533 Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the
13534 slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side
13535 lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then
13536 dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards,
13537 and so hauled out poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first
13538 thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing that that
13539 was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble;—he had
13540 thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a
13541 somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial, he came forth in
13542 the good old way—head foremost. As for the great head itself, that was
13543 doing as well as could be expected.
13544 
13545 And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of
13546 Queequeg, the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was
13547 successfully accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and
13548 apparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be
13549 forgotten. Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing
13550 and boxing, riding and rowing.
13551 
13552 I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header’s will be sure to
13553 seem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have
13554 either seen or heard of some one’s falling into a cistern ashore; an
13555 accident which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than
13556 the Indian’s, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the
13557 Sperm Whale’s well.
13558 
13559 But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought
13560 the tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and
13561 most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of
13562 a far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at
13563 all, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had
13564 been nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the
13565 dense tendinous wall of the well—a double welded, hammered substance,
13566 as I have before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of
13567 which sinks in it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking
13568 in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted
13569 by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it, so that it
13570 sank very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair
13571 chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say.
13572 Yes, it was a running delivery, so it was.
13573 
13574 Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious
13575 perishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant
13576 spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber
13577 and sanctum sanctorum of the whale. Only one sweeter end can readily be
13578 recalled—the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking honey
13579 in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it, that
13580 leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed. How
13581 many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato’s honey head, and
13582 sweetly perished there?
13583 
13584 
13585 CHAPTER 79. The Prairie.
13586 
13587 To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this
13588 Leviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has
13589 as yet undertaken. Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as
13590 for Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar,
13591 or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the
13592 Pantheon. Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater not only treats of
13593 the various faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces of
13594 horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the
13595 modifications of expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and his
13596 disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the
13597 phrenological characteristics of other beings than man. Therefore,
13598 though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the application of
13599 these two semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my endeavor. I try all
13600 things; I achieve what I can.
13601 
13602 Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He
13603 has no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most
13604 conspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and
13605 finally controls their combined expression; hence it would seem that
13606 its entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely affect
13607 the countenance of the whale. For as in landscape gardening, a spire,
13608 cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable
13609 to the completion of the scene; so no face can be physiognomically in
13610 keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose. Dash the
13611 nose from Phidias’s marble Jove, and what a sorry remainder!
13612 Nevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all his
13613 proportions are so stately, that the same deficiency which in the
13614 sculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all. Nay, it is
13615 an added grandeur. A nose to the whale would have been impertinent. As
13616 on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your
13617 jolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the
13618 reflection that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which
13619 so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest
13620 royal beadle on his throne.
13621 
13622 In some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to
13623 be had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. This
13624 aspect is sublime.
13625 
13626 In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the
13627 morning. In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has
13628 a touch of the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles,
13629 the elephant’s brow is majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is
13630 as that great golden seal affixed by the German emperors to their
13631 decrees. It signifies—“God: done this day by my hand.” But in most
13632 creatures, nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip
13633 of alpine land lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which
13634 like Shakespeare’s or Melancthon’s rise so high, and descend so low,
13635 that the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes;
13636 and all above them in the forehead’s wrinkles, you seem to track the
13637 antlered thoughts descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters
13638 track the snow prints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this
13639 high and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely
13640 amplified, that gazing on it, in that full front view, you feel the
13641 Deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other
13642 object in living nature. For you see no one point precisely; not one
13643 distinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face;
13644 he has none, proper; nothing but that one broad firmament of a
13645 forehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats,
13646 and ships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish;
13647 though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so. In
13648 profile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic
13649 depression in the forehead’s middle, which, in man, is Lavater’s mark
13650 of genius.
13651 
13652 But how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written a
13653 book, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his doing
13654 nothing particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his
13655 pyramidical silence. And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale
13656 been known to the young Orient World, he would have been deified by
13657 their child-magian thoughts. They deified the crocodile of the Nile,
13658 because the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue,
13659 or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of
13660 protrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall
13661 lure back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and
13662 livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky; in the now
13663 unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove’s high seat, the great
13664 Sperm Whale shall lord it.
13665 
13666 Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is
13667 no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man’s and every being’s
13668 face. Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing
13669 fable. If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could
13670 not read the simplest peasant’s face in its profounder and more subtle
13671 meanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of
13672 the Sperm Whale’s brow? I but put that brow before you. Read it if you
13673 can.
13674 
13675 
13676 CHAPTER 80. The Nut.
13677 
13678 If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist
13679 his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to
13680 square.
13681 
13682 In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet
13683 in length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as
13684 the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level
13685 base. But in life—as we have elsewhere seen—this inclined plane is
13686 angularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent
13687 mass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater to
13688 bed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this crater—in
13689 another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in
13690 depth—reposes the mere handful of this monster’s brain. The brain is at
13691 least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away
13692 behind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the
13693 amplified fortifications of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it
13694 secreted in him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny
13695 that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance
13696 of one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying in
13697 strange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it
13698 seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that
13699 mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence.
13700 
13701 It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in
13702 the creature’s living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his
13703 true brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The
13704 whale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the
13705 common world.
13706 
13707 If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view
13708 of its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its
13709 resemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from
13710 the same point of view. Indeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down
13711 to the human magnitude) among a plate of men’s skulls, and you would
13712 involuntarily confound it with them; and remarking the depressions on
13713 one part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would say—This man
13714 had no self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those negations,
13715 considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and
13716 power, you can best form to yourself the truest, though not the most
13717 exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is.
13718 
13719 But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale’s proper brain, you
13720 deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea
13721 for you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped’s spine, you
13722 will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebræ to a strung
13723 necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the
13724 skull proper. It is a German conceit, that the vertebræ are absolutely
13725 undeveloped skulls. But the curious external resemblance, I take it the
13726 Germans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign friend once
13727 pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with
13728 the vertebræ of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the
13729 beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists have
13730 omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the
13731 cerebellum through the spinal canal. For I believe that much of a man’s
13732 character will be found betokened in his backbone. I would rather feel
13733 your spine than your skull, whoever you are. A thin joist of a spine
13734 never yet upheld a full and noble soul. I rejoice in my spine, as in
13735 the firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the
13736 world.
13737 
13738 Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial
13739 cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra
13740 the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being
13741 eight in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As
13742 it passes through the remaining vertebræ the canal tapers in size, but
13743 for a considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course,
13744 this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance—the
13745 spinal cord—as the brain; and directly communicates with the brain. And
13746 what is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain’s
13747 cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal
13748 to that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be
13749 unreasonable to survey and map out the whale’s spine phrenologically?
13750 For, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his
13751 brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative
13752 magnitude of his spinal cord.
13753 
13754 But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I
13755 would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the
13756 Sperm Whale’s hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one
13757 of the larger vertebræ, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer
13758 convex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should call
13759 this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm
13760 Whale. And that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have
13761 reason to know.
13762 
13763 
13764 CHAPTER 81. The Pequod Meets The Virgin.
13765 
13766 The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau,
13767 Derick De Deer, master, of Bremen.
13768 
13769 At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and
13770 Germans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide
13771 intervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with
13772 their flag in the Pacific.
13773 
13774 For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.
13775 While yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a
13776 boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the
13777 bows instead of the stern.
13778 
13779 “What has he in his hand there?” cried Starbuck, pointing to something
13780 wavingly held by the German. “Impossible!—a lamp-feeder!”
13781 
13782 “Not that,” said Stubb, “no, no, it’s a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he’s
13783 coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don’t you see that big
13784 tin can there alongside of him?—that’s his boiling water. Oh! he’s all
13785 right, is the Yarman.”
13786 
13787 “Go along with you,” cried Flask, “it’s a lamp-feeder and an oil-can.
13788 He’s out of oil, and has come a-begging.”
13789 
13790 However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the
13791 whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old
13792 proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing
13793 really happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did
13794 indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.
13795 
13796 As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all
13797 heeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German
13798 soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately
13799 turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some
13800 remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in
13801 profound darkness—his last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a
13802 single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding by
13803 hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically
13804 called a _clean_ one (that is, an empty one), well deserving the name
13805 of Jungfrau or the Virgin.
13806 
13807 His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his
13808 ship’s side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the
13809 mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that
13810 without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed
13811 round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.
13812 
13813 Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German
13814 boats that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the
13815 Pequod’s keels. There were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of their
13816 danger, they were going all abreast with great speed straight before
13817 the wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in
13818 harness. They left a great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling
13819 a great wide parchment upon the sea.
13820 
13821 Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge,
13822 humped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as
13823 by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed
13824 afflicted with the jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this
13825 whale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is
13826 not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social.
13827 Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water
13828 must have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad
13829 muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile
13830 currents meet. His spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming forth
13831 with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself in torn shreds,
13832 followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which seemed to
13833 have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters behind
13834 him to upbubble.
13835 
13836 “Who’s got some paregoric?” said Stubb, “he has the stomach-ache, I’m
13837 afraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse
13838 winds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It’s the first foul wind
13839 I ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so
13840 before? it must be, he’s lost his tiller.”
13841 
13842 As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck
13843 load of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her
13844 way; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly
13845 turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious
13846 wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost
13847 that fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.
13848 
13849 “Only wait a bit, old chap, and I’ll give ye a sling for that wounded
13850 arm,” cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.
13851 
13852 “Mind he don’t sling thee with it,” cried Starbuck. “Give way, or the
13853 German will have him.”
13854 
13855 With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one
13856 fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most
13857 valuable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were
13858 going with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for
13859 the time. At this juncture the Pequod’s keels had shot by the three
13860 German boats last lowered; but from the great start he had had,
13861 Derick’s boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his
13862 foreign rivals. The only thing they feared, was, that from being
13863 already so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron
13864 before they could completely overtake and pass him. As for Derick, he
13865 seemed quite confident that this would be the case, and occasionally
13866 with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the other boats.
13867 
13868 “The ungracious and ungrateful dog!” cried Starbuck; “he mocks and
13869 dares me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes
13870 ago!”—then in his old intense whisper—“Give way, greyhounds! Dog to
13871 it!”
13872 
13873 “I tell ye what it is, men”—cried Stubb to his crew—“it’s against my
13874 religion to get mad; but I’d like to eat that villainous
13875 Yarman—Pull—won’t ye? Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye? Do ye
13876 love brandy? A hogshead of brandy, then, to the best man. Come, why
13877 don’t some of ye burst a blood-vessel? Who’s that been dropping an
13878 anchor overboard—we don’t budge an inch—we’re becalmed. Halloo, here’s
13879 grass growing in the boat’s bottom—and by the Lord, the mast there’s
13880 budding. This won’t do, boys. Look at that Yarman! The short and long
13881 of it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?”
13882 
13883 “Oh! see the suds he makes!” cried Flask, dancing up and down—“What a
13884 hump—Oh, _do_ pile on the beef—lays like a log! Oh! my lads, _do_
13885 spring—slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my lads—baked clams
13886 and muffins—oh, _do_, _do_, spring,—he’s a hundred barreller—don’t lose
13887 him now—don’t oh, _don’t!_—see that Yarman—Oh, won’t ye pull for your
13888 duff, my lads—such a sog! such a sogger! Don’t ye love sperm? There
13889 goes three thousand dollars, men!—a bank!—a whole bank! The bank of
13890 England!—Oh, _do_, _do_, _do!_—What’s that Yarman about now?”
13891 
13892 At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the
13893 advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view of
13894 retarding his rivals’ way, and at the same time economically
13895 accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.
13896 
13897 “The unmannerly Dutch dogger!” cried Stubb. “Pull now, men, like fifty
13898 thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils. What d’ye say,
13899 Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces
13900 for the honor of old Gayhead? What d’ye say?”
13901 
13902 “I say, pull like god-dam,”—cried the Indian.
13903 
13904 Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod’s
13905 three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,
13906 momentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the
13907 headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up
13908 proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating
13909 cry of, “There she slides, now! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down
13910 with the Yarman! Sail over him!”
13911 
13912 But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all
13913 their gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not
13914 a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the
13915 blade of his midship oarsman. While this clumsy lubber was striving to
13916 free his white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick’s boat was nigh
13917 to capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;—that
13918 was a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took
13919 a mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the German’s
13920 quarter. An instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the
13921 whale’s immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was
13922 the foaming swell that he made.
13923 
13924 It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was
13925 now going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual
13926 tormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of
13927 fright. Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering
13928 flight, and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank
13929 in the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So
13930 have I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles
13931 in the air, vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird
13932 has a voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the
13933 fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted
13934 in him; he had no voice, save that choking respiration through his
13935 spiracle, and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while
13936 still, in his amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there
13937 was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied.
13938 
13939 Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod’s
13940 boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick
13941 chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long
13942 dart, ere the last chance would for ever escape.
13943 
13944 But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all
13945 three tigers—Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo—instinctively sprang to their
13946 feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their
13947 barbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three
13948 Nantucket irons entered the whale. Blinding vapors of foam and
13949 white-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the whale’s headlong
13950 rush, bumped the German’s aside with such force, that both Derick and
13951 his baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three
13952 flying keels.
13953 
13954 “Don’t be afraid, my butter-boxes,” cried Stubb, casting a passing
13955 glance upon them as he shot by; “ye’ll be picked up presently—all
13956 right—I saw some sharks astern—St. Bernard’s dogs, you know—relieve
13957 distressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every keel
13958 a sunbeam! Hurrah!—Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a
13959 mad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a
13960 tilbury on a plain—makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to
13961 him that way; and there’s danger of being pitched out too, when you
13962 strike a hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he’s going
13963 to Davy Jones—all a rush down an endless inclined plane! Hurrah! this
13964 whale carries the everlasting mail!”
13965 
13966 But the monster’s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he
13967 tumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round
13968 the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them;
13969 while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would
13970 soon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they
13971 caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at
13972 last—owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of
13973 the boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue—the
13974 gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while the three
13975 sterns tilted high in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for
13976 some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more
13977 line, though the position was a little ticklish. But though boats have
13978 been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this “holding on,” as
13979 it is called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from
13980 the back; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising
13981 again to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the
13982 peril of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always
13983 the best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the
13984 stricken whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. Because,
13985 owing to the enormous surface of him—in a full grown sperm whale
13986 something less than 2000 square feet—the pressure of the water is
13987 immense. We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we
13988 ourselves stand up under; even here, above-ground, in the air; how
13989 vast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a column of two
13990 hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal the weight of fifty
13991 atmospheres. One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty
13992 line-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on
13993 board.
13994 
13995 As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down
13996 into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any
13997 sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths;
13998 what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that silence and
13999 placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in
14000 agony! Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows.
14001 Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan
14002 was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and
14003 to what? To three bits of board. Is this the creature of whom it was
14004 once so triumphantly said—“Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?
14005 or his head with fish-spears? The sword of him that layeth at him
14006 cannot hold, the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron
14007 as straw; the arrow cannot make him flee; darts are counted as stubble;
14008 he laugheth at the shaking of a spear!” This the creature? this he? Oh!
14009 that unfulfilments should follow the prophets. For with the strength of
14010 a thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the
14011 mountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod’s fish-spears!
14012 
14013 In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats
14014 sent down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad
14015 enough to shade half Xerxes’ army. Who can tell how appalling to the
14016 wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!
14017 
14018 “Stand by, men; he stirs,” cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly
14019 vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by
14020 magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every
14021 oarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in great part
14022 from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce
14023 upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are
14024 scared from it into the sea.
14025 
14026 “Haul in! Haul in!” cried Starbuck again; “he’s rising.”
14027 
14028 The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand’s breadth
14029 could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all
14030 dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two
14031 ship’s lengths of the hunters.
14032 
14033 His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land
14034 animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins,
14035 whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly
14036 shut off in certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose
14037 peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the
14038 blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point as a
14039 harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial
14040 system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of
14041 water at a great distance below the surface, his life may be said to
14042 pour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of
14043 blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior fountains, that
14044 he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period; even
14045 as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the well-springs
14046 of far-off and undiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats pulled
14047 upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and the
14048 lances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from the
14049 new made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural
14050 spout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending
14051 its affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet
14052 came, because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life,
14053 as they significantly call it, was untouched.
14054 
14055 As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of
14056 his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly
14057 revealed. His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were
14058 beheld. As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the
14059 noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale’s eyes
14060 had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see.
14061 But pity there was none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his
14062 blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light
14063 the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate
14064 the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to
14065 all. Still rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a
14066 strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low
14067 down on the flank.
14068 
14069 “A nice spot,” cried Flask; “just let me prick him there once.”
14070 
14071 “Avast!” cried Starbuck, “there’s no need of that!”
14072 
14073 But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an
14074 ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more
14075 than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift
14076 fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying
14077 crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask’s boat and marring
14078 the bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he
14079 by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had
14080 made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin,
14081 then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the
14082 white secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most
14083 piteous, that last expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water is
14084 gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled
14085 melancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the
14086 ground—so the last long dying spout of the whale.
14087 
14088 Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body
14089 showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.
14090 Immediately, by Starbuck’s orders, lines were secured to it at
14091 different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken
14092 whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords. By very
14093 heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred
14094 to her side, and was strongly secured there by the stiffest
14095 fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially upheld, the
14096 body would at once sink to the bottom.
14097 
14098 It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade,
14099 the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his
14100 flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the
14101 stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured
14102 whales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence
14103 of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs have
14104 been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for
14105 the ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a
14106 lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron,
14107 the flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And
14108 when? It might have been darted by some Nor’ West Indian long before
14109 America was discovered.
14110 
14111 What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous
14112 cabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further
14113 discoveries, by the ship’s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways
14114 to the sea, owing to the body’s immensely increasing tendency to sink.
14115 However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to
14116 the last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the
14117 ship would have been capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with
14118 the body; then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such
14119 was the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the
14120 fluke-chains and cables were fastened, that it was impossible to cast
14121 them off. Meantime everything in the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the
14122 other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a
14123 house. The ship groaned and gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her
14124 bulwarks and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural
14125 dislocation. In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the
14126 immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads; and so
14127 low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at
14128 all approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed
14129 added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going
14130 over.
14131 
14132 “Hold on, hold on, won’t ye?” cried Stubb to the body, “don’t be in
14133 such a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something
14134 or go for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes,
14135 and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big
14136 chains.”
14137 
14138 “Knife? Aye, aye,” cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter’s heavy
14139 hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing
14140 at the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were
14141 given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific
14142 snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.
14143 
14144 Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm
14145 Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately
14146 accounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great
14147 buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the
14148 surface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and
14149 broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their
14150 bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that
14151 this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so
14152 sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it
14153 is not so. For young whales, in the highest health, and swelling with
14154 noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of
14155 life, with all their panting lard about them; even these brawny,
14156 buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.
14157 
14158 Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this
14159 accident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty
14160 Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable
14161 in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale;
14162 his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this
14163 incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances
14164 where, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale
14165 again rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this is
14166 obvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious
14167 magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship
14168 could hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings,
14169 among the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of
14170 sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when
14171 the body has gone down, they know where to look for it when it shall
14172 have ascended again.
14173 
14174 It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from
14175 the Pequod’s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again
14176 lowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a
14177 Fin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of
14178 its incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back’s spout is
14179 so similar to the Sperm Whale’s, that by unskilful fishermen it is
14180 often mistaken for it. And consequently Derick and all his host were
14181 now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all
14182 sail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared
14183 far to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.
14184 
14185 Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.
14186 
14187 
14188 CHAPTER 82. The Honor and Glory of Whaling.
14189 
14190 There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the
14191 true method.
14192 
14193 The more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up
14194 to the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with its
14195 great honorableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many
14196 great demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other
14197 have shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the reflection
14198 that I myself belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a
14199 fraternity.
14200 
14201 The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to
14202 the eternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first whale
14203 attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent.
14204 Those were the knightly days of our profession, when we only bore arms
14205 to succor the distressed, and not to fill men’s lamp-feeders. Every one
14206 knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the lovely
14207 Andromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast,
14208 and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the
14209 prince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster, and
14210 delivered and married the maid. It was an admirable artistic exploit,
14211 rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as
14212 this Leviathan was slain at the very first dart. And let no man doubt
14213 this Arkite story; for in the ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian
14214 coast, in one of the Pagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast
14215 skeleton of a whale, which the city’s legends and all the inhabitants
14216 asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew.
14217 When the Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to Italy in
14218 triumph. What seems most singular and suggestively important in this
14219 story, is this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.
14220 
14221 Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda—indeed, by some supposed
14222 to be indirectly derived from it—is that famous story of St. George and
14223 the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale; for in many
14224 old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together, and
14225 often stand for each other. “Thou art as a lion of the waters, and as a
14226 dragon of the sea,” saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning a whale; in
14227 truth, some versions of the Bible use that word itself. Besides, it
14228 would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St. George but
14229 encountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of doing battle
14230 with the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake, but only
14231 a Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to march
14232 boldly up to a whale.
14233 
14234 Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the
14235 creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely
14236 represented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted
14237 on land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance
14238 of those times, when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists;
14239 and considering that as in Perseus’ case, St. George’s whale might have
14240 crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and considering that the animal
14241 ridden by St. George might have been only a large seal, or sea-horse;
14242 bearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible
14243 with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to
14244 hold this so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself.
14245 In fact, placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story
14246 will fare like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines,
14247 Dagon by name; who being planted before the ark of Israel, his horse’s
14248 head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the
14249 stump or fishy part of him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble
14250 stamp, even a whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England; and by
14251 good rights, we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most
14252 noble order of St. George. And therefore, let not the knights of that
14253 honorable company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do
14254 with a whale like their great patron), let them never eye a Nantucketer
14255 with disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we
14256 are much better entitled to St. George’s decoration than they.
14257 
14258 Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long
14259 remained dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that
14260 antique Crockett and Kit Carson—that brawny doer of rejoicing good
14261 deeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether that
14262 strictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted. It nowhere
14263 appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from
14264 the inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary
14265 whaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the whale. I
14266 claim him for one of our clan.
14267 
14268 But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of
14269 Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more
14270 ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versâ; certainly
14271 they are very similar. If I claim the demi-god then, why not the
14272 prophet?
14273 
14274 Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole
14275 roll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like
14276 royal kings of old times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in
14277 nothing short of the great gods themselves. That wondrous oriental
14278 story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster, which gives us the dread
14279 Vishnoo, one of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos; gives
14280 us this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord;—Vishnoo, who, by the first
14281 of his ten earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and sanctified
14282 the whale. When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved
14283 to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave
14284 birth to Vishnoo, to preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical
14285 books, whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo
14286 before beginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained
14287 something in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these
14288 Vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became
14289 incarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths,
14290 rescued the sacred volumes. Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even
14291 as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman?
14292 
14293 Perseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there’s a
14294 member-roll for you! What club but the whaleman’s can head off like
14295 that?
14296 
14297 
14298 CHAPTER 83. Jonah Historically Regarded.
14299 
14300 Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in
14301 the preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this
14302 historical story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some
14303 sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans
14304 of their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale,
14305 and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did
14306 not make those traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.
14307 
14308 One old Sag-Harbor whaleman’s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew
14309 story was this:—He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,
14310 embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented
14311 Jonah’s whale with two spouts in his head—a peculiarity only true with
14312 respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the
14313 varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this
14314 saying, “A penny roll would choke him”; his swallow is so very small.
14315 But, to this, Bishop Jebb’s anticipative answer is ready. It is not
14316 necessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the
14317 whale’s belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And
14318 this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right
14319 Whale’s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and
14320 comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have
14321 ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right
14322 Whale is toothless.
14323 
14324 Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his
14325 want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in
14326 reference to his incarcerated body and the whale’s gastric juices. But
14327 this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist
14328 supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a
14329 _dead_ whale—even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned
14330 their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has
14331 been divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was
14332 thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his
14333 escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a
14334 figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called “The Whale,” as some
14335 craft are nowadays christened the “Shark,” the “Gull,” the “Eagle.” Nor
14336 have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the
14337 whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver—an
14338 inflated bag of wind—which the endangered prophet swam to, and so was
14339 saved from a watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all
14340 round. But he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was
14341 this, if I remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the
14342 Mediterranean Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere
14343 within three days’ journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much
14344 more than three days’ journey across from the nearest point of the
14345 Mediterranean coast. How is that?
14346 
14347 But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within
14348 that short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by
14349 the way of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage
14350 through the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up
14351 the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the
14352 complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of
14353 the Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any
14354 whale to swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah’s weathering the Cape of
14355 Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of
14356 that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and
14357 so make modern history a liar.
14358 
14359 But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his
14360 foolish pride of reason—a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing
14361 that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the
14362 sun and the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and
14363 abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. For by a
14364 Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah’s going to Nineveh
14365 via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the
14366 general miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the highly
14367 enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah.
14368 And some three centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harris’s
14369 Voyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honor of Jonah, in which
14370 Mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil.
14371 
14372 
14373 CHAPTER 84. Pitchpoling.
14374 
14375 To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are
14376 anointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an
14377 analogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it
14378 to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly
14379 be of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and water are
14380 hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object in view is to
14381 make the boat slide bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in anointing
14382 his boat, and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau
14383 disappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation;
14384 crawling under its bottom, where it hung over the side, and rubbing in
14385 the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair
14386 from the craft’s bald keel. He seemed to be working in obedience to
14387 some particular presentiment. Nor did it remain unwarranted by the
14388 event.
14389 
14390 Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to
14391 them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered
14392 flight, as of Cleopatra’s barges from Actium.
14393 
14394 Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb’s was foremost. By great
14395 exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the
14396 stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal
14397 flight, with added fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings upon the
14398 planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It became
14399 imperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose him. But to
14400 haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and
14401 furious. What then remained?
14402 
14403 Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and
14404 countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced,
14405 none exceed that fine manœuvre with the lance called pitchpoling. Small
14406 sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It
14407 is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale; its grand fact
14408 and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is
14409 accurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme
14410 headway. Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or
14411 twelve feet in length; the staff is much slighter than that of the
14412 harpoon, and also of a lighter material—pine. It is furnished with a
14413 small rope called a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be
14414 hauled back to the hand after darting.
14415 
14416 But before going further, it is important to mention here, that though
14417 the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it is
14418 seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently successful, on
14419 account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as
14420 compared with the lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks. As a
14421 general thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before
14422 any pitchpoling comes into play.
14423 
14424 Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and
14425 equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel
14426 in pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the
14427 flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet
14428 ahead. Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along
14429 its length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers
14430 up the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in
14431 his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full
14432 before his waistband’s middle, he levels it at the whale; when,
14433 covering him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand,
14434 thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon
14435 his palm, fifteen feet in the air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler,
14436 balancing a long staff on his chin. Next moment with a rapid, nameless
14437 impulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming
14438 distance, and quivers in the life spot of the whale. Instead of
14439 sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.
14440 
14441 “That drove the spigot out of him!” cried Stubb. “’Tis July’s immortal
14442 Fourth; all fountains must run wine today! Would now, it were old
14443 Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela! Then,
14444 Tashtego, lad, I’d have ye hold a canakin to the jet, and we’d drink
14445 round it! Yea, verily, hearts alive, we’d brew choice punch in the
14446 spread of his spout-hole there, and from that live punch-bowl quaff the
14447 living stuff.”
14448 
14449 Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated,
14450 the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful
14451 leash. The agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is
14452 slackened, and the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and
14453 mutely watches the monster die.
14454 
14455 
14456 CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.
14457 
14458 That for six thousand years—and no one knows how many millions of ages
14459 before—the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea, and
14460 sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so many
14461 sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back,
14462 thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the
14463 whale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings—that all this should
14464 be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter
14465 minutes past one o’clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D.
14466 1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings are,
14467 after all, really water, or nothing but vapor—this is surely a
14468 noteworthy thing.
14469 
14470 Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items
14471 contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their
14472 gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times
14473 is combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a
14474 cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the
14475 surface. But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him
14476 regular lungs, like a human being’s, the whale can only live by
14477 inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the
14478 necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot
14479 in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude,
14480 the Sperm Whale’s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the
14481 surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no connexion with his
14482 mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the
14483 top of his head.
14484 
14485 If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function
14486 indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a
14487 certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with the
14488 blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I
14489 shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.
14490 Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be
14491 aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not
14492 fetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then
14493 live without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the
14494 case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full
14495 hour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or
14496 so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has
14497 no gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his spine
14498 he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of
14499 vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are
14500 completely distended with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or
14501 more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of
14502 vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert
14503 carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four
14504 supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is
14505 indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable
14506 and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise
14507 inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in _having his spoutings out_,
14508 as the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon
14509 rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period
14510 of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he
14511 stays eleven minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy
14512 breaths; then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his
14513 seventy breaths over again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few
14514 breaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up
14515 again to make good his regular allowance of air. And not till those
14516 seventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay out his full
14517 term below. Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates
14518 are different; but in any one they are alike. Now, why should the whale
14519 thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish
14520 his reservoir of air, ere descending for good? How obvious is it, too,
14521 that this necessity for the whale’s rising exposes him to all the fatal
14522 hazards of the chase. For not by hook or by net could this vast
14523 leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the
14524 sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the great
14525 necessities that strike the victory to thee!
14526 
14527 In man, breathing is incessantly going on—one breath only serving for
14528 two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to
14529 attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the
14530 Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.
14531 
14532 It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole;
14533 if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water,
14534 then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of
14535 smell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at
14536 all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so
14537 clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power
14538 of smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout—whether it be water
14539 or whether it be vapor—no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at
14540 on this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no
14541 proper olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no
14542 violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.
14543 
14544 Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting
14545 canal, and as that long canal—like the grand Erie Canal—is furnished
14546 with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of
14547 air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice;
14548 unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles, he
14549 talks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to say?
14550 Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to this
14551 world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a
14552 living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!
14553 
14554 Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is
14555 for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,
14556 horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little
14557 to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down
14558 in a city on one side of a street. But the question returns whether
14559 this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout
14560 of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether
14561 that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and
14562 discharged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth
14563 indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be
14564 proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the
14565 spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be,
14566 when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale’s
14567 food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he
14568 would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your
14569 watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating
14570 rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of
14571 respiration.
14572 
14573 But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out!
14574 You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not
14575 tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to
14576 settle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the
14577 knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand
14578 in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.
14579 
14580 The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping
14581 it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it,
14582 when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view
14583 of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all
14584 around him. And if at such times you should think that you really
14585 perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are
14586 not merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are
14587 not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole
14588 fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale’s head? For
14589 even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with
14590 his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary’s in the desert; even then,
14591 the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a
14592 blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with
14593 rain.
14594 
14595 Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the
14596 precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering
14597 into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to
14598 this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into
14599 slight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will
14600 often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of
14601 the thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer
14602 contact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or
14603 otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm.
14604 Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to
14605 evade it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt
14606 it, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind
14607 you. The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is
14608 to let this deadly spout alone.
14609 
14610 Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My
14611 hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides
14612 other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations
14613 touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I
14614 account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed
14615 fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other
14616 whales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound. And I am
14617 convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as
14618 Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes
14619 up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep
14620 thoughts. While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the
14621 curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere long saw reflected
14622 there, a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over
14623 my head. The invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep
14624 thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an
14625 August noon; this seems an additional argument for the above
14626 supposition.
14627 
14628 And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to
14629 behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild
14630 head overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable
14631 contemplations, and that vapor—as you will sometimes see it—glorified
14632 by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts.
14633 For, d’ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate
14634 vapor. And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my
14635 mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a
14636 heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny;
14637 but doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of
14638 all things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this
14639 combination makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who
14640 regards them both with equal eye.
14641 
14642 
14643 CHAPTER 86. The Tail.
14644 
14645 Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,
14646 and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial,
14647 I celebrate a tail.
14648 
14649 Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale’s tail to begin at that point
14650 of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises
14651 upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet.
14652 The compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat
14653 palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in
14654 thickness. At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap,
14655 then sideways recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy
14656 between. In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely
14657 defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost
14658 expansion in the full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed
14659 twenty feet across.
14660 
14661 The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut
14662 into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:—upper,
14663 middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long
14664 and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running
14665 crosswise between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as
14666 anything else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old Roman
14667 walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin
14668 course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful
14669 relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the
14670 great strength of the masonry.
14671 
14672 But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough,
14673 the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of
14674 muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins
14675 and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and
14676 largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the confluent
14677 measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point.
14678 Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do it.
14679 
14680 Nor does this—its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful
14681 flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates through a
14682 Titanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive their most
14683 appalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty or
14684 harmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly
14685 beautiful, strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied
14686 tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved
14687 Hercules, and its charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the
14688 linen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with
14689 the massive chest of the man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch.
14690 When Angelo paints even God the Father in human form, mark what
14691 robustness is there. And whatever they may reveal of the divine love in
14692 the Son, the soft, curled, hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which
14693 his idea has been most successfully embodied; these pictures, so
14694 destitute as they are of all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but
14695 the mere negative, feminine one of submission and endurance, which on
14696 all hands it is conceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his
14697 teachings.
14698 
14699 Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether
14700 wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it
14701 be in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein
14702 no fairy’s arm can transcend it.
14703 
14704 Five great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for
14705 progression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping;
14706 Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.
14707 
14708 First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan’s tail acts in a
14709 different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never
14710 wriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the
14711 whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled
14712 forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is
14713 this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster
14714 when furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.
14715 
14716 Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only
14717 fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his
14718 conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In
14719 striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the
14720 blow is only inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed
14721 air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply
14722 irresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only
14723 salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the
14724 opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the
14725 whale-boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a
14726 dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the
14727 most serious result. These submerged side blows are so often received
14728 in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child’s play. Some one
14729 strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.
14730 
14731 Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale
14732 the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect
14733 there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the
14734 elephant’s trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of
14735 sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft
14736 slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of
14737 the sea; and if he feel but a sailor’s whisker, woe to that sailor,
14738 whiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch!
14739 Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of
14740 Darmonodes’ elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with low
14741 salutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their
14742 zones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not
14743 possess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet
14744 another elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his
14745 trunk and extracted the dart.
14746 
14747 Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the
14748 middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence
14749 of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a
14750 hearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of his
14751 tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the
14752 thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a
14753 great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of
14754 vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that
14755 that was the smoke from the touch-hole.
14756 
14757 Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes
14758 lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely
14759 out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into
14760 the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are
14761 tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they
14762 downwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime _breach_—somewhere
14763 else to be described—this peaking of the whale’s flukes is perhaps the
14764 grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless
14765 profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the
14766 highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting
14767 forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in
14768 gazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the
14769 Dantean, the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the
14770 archangels. Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that
14771 crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east,
14772 all heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with
14773 peaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment
14774 of adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of
14775 the fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African
14776 elephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most
14777 devout of all beings. For according to King Juba, the military
14778 elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks
14779 uplifted in the profoundest silence.
14780 
14781 The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the
14782 elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk
14783 of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two opposite
14784 organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they
14785 respectively belong. For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to
14786 Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan’s tail, his trunk is but the
14787 stalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the elephant’s trunk were
14788 as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and
14789 crash of the sperm whale’s ponderous flukes, which in repeated
14790 instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their
14791 oars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses his
14792 balls.*
14793 
14794 *Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and
14795 the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the
14796 elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does
14797 to the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of
14798 curious similitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that the
14799 elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then
14800 elevating it, jet it forth in a stream.
14801 
14802 The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my
14803 inability to express it. At times there are gestures in it, which,
14804 though they would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly
14805 inexplicable. In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are
14806 these mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters who have declared them
14807 akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by these
14808 methods intelligently conversed with the world. Nor are there wanting
14809 other motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness,
14810 and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant. Dissect him how I
14811 may, then, I but go skin deep; I know him not, and never will. But if I
14812 know not even the tail of this whale, how understand his head? much
14813 more, how comprehend his face, when face he has none? Thou shalt see my
14814 back parts, my tail, he seems to say, but my face shall not be seen.
14815 But I cannot completely make out his back parts; and hint what he will
14816 about his face, I say again he has no face.
14817 
14818 
14819 CHAPTER 87. The Grand Armada.
14820 
14821 The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from
14822 the territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all Asia.
14823 In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of
14824 Sumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others, form a vast
14825 mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia, and
14826 dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded
14827 oriental archipelagoes. This rampart is pierced by several sally-ports
14828 for the convenience of ships and whales; conspicuous among which are
14829 the straits of Sunda and Malacca. By the straits of Sunda, chiefly,
14830 vessels bound to China from the west, emerge into the China seas.
14831 
14832 Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing
14833 midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green
14834 promontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond
14835 to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and
14836 considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and silks, and jewels,
14837 and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand islands of that oriental
14838 sea are enriched, it seems a significant provision of nature, that such
14839 treasures, by the very formation of the land, should at least bear the
14840 appearance, however ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping
14841 western world. The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with
14842 those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the
14843 Mediterranean, the Baltic, and the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these
14844 Orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from
14845 the endless procession of ships before the wind, which for centuries
14846 past, by night and by day, have passed between the islands of Sumatra
14847 and Java, freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east. But while
14848 they freely waive a ceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce
14849 their claim to more solid tribute.
14850 
14851 Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the
14852 low shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the
14853 vessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the
14854 point of their spears. Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they
14855 have received at the hands of European cruisers, the audacity of these
14856 corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed; yet, even at the present
14857 day, we occasionally hear of English and American vessels, which, in
14858 those waters, have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.
14859 
14860 With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these
14861 straits; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and
14862 thence, cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here
14863 and there by the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands,
14864 and gain the far coast of Japan, in time for the great whaling season
14865 there. By these means, the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost
14866 all the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the world, previous to
14867 descending upon the Line in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere
14868 else foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby
14869 Dick, in the sea he was most known to frequent; and at a season when he
14870 might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it.
14871 
14872 But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his
14873 crew drink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time,
14874 now, the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs
14875 no sustenance but what’s in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the
14876 whaler. While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be
14877 transferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries
14878 no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a
14879 whole lake’s contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with
14880 utilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She
14881 carries years’ water in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which,
14882 when three years afloat, the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to
14883 drink before the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks,
14884 from the Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, while other
14885 ships may have gone to China from New York, and back again, touching at
14886 a score of ports, the whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have
14887 sighted one grain of soil; her crew having seen no man but floating
14888 seamen like themselves. So that did you carry them the news that
14889 another flood had come; they would only answer—“Well, boys, here’s the
14890 ark!”
14891 
14892 Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of
14893 Java, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of
14894 the ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an
14895 excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and
14896 more upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and
14897 admonished to keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the
14898 land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the
14899 fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was
14900 descried. Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game
14901 hereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the
14902 customary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle
14903 of singular magnificence saluted us.
14904 
14905 But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with
14906 which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm
14907 Whales, instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached
14908 companies, as in former times, are now frequently met with in extensive
14909 herds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost
14910 seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and
14911 covenant for mutual assistance and protection. To this aggregation of
14912 the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans, may be imputed the
14913 circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds, you may now
14914 sometimes sail for weeks and months together, without being greeted by
14915 a single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems
14916 thousands on thousands.
14917 
14918 Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and
14919 forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a
14920 continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the
14921 noon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right
14922 Whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like the
14923 cleft drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting spout of
14924 the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually
14925 rising and falling away to leeward.
14926 
14927 Seen from the Pequod’s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of
14928 the sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the
14929 air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed
14930 like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried
14931 of a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.
14932 
14933 As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,
14934 accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in
14935 their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the
14936 plain; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward
14937 through the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their
14938 semicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.
14939 
14940 Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers
14941 handling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet
14942 suspended boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that
14943 chased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy
14944 into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their
14945 number. And who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby
14946 Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped
14947 white-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So with
14948 stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans
14949 before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly
14950 directing attention to something in our wake.
14951 
14952 Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our
14953 rear. It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling
14954 something like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so
14955 completely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally
14956 disappearing. Levelling his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved
14957 in his pivot-hole, crying, “Aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to
14958 wet the sails;—Malays, sir, and after us!”
14959 
14960 As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should
14961 fairly have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in
14962 hot pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay. But when the
14963 swift Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase; how
14964 very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on
14965 to her own chosen pursuit,—mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that
14966 they were. As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in
14967 his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one
14968 the bloodthirsty pirates chasing _him_; some such fancy as the above
14969 seemed his. And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery
14970 defile in which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that
14971 through that gate lay the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how that
14972 through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his
14973 deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates
14974 and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with
14975 their curses;—when all these conceits had passed through his brain,
14976 Ahab’s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after
14977 some stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the
14978 firm thing from its place.
14979 
14980 But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and
14981 when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the
14982 Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra
14983 side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the
14984 harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been
14985 gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so
14986 victoriously gained upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake
14987 of the whales, at length they seemed abating their speed; gradually the
14988 ship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was passed to
14989 spring to the boats. But no sooner did the herd, by some presumed
14990 wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of the three
14991 keels that were after them,—though as yet a mile in their rear,—than
14992 they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and battalions, so that
14993 their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved
14994 on with redoubled velocity.
14995 
14996 Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and
14997 after several hours’ pulling were almost disposed to renounce the
14998 chase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating
14999 token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange
15000 perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it
15001 in the whale, they say he is gallied. The compact martial columns in
15002 which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming, were now
15003 broken up in one measureless rout; and like King Porus’ elephants in
15004 the Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed going mad with
15005 consternation. In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles,
15006 and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their short thick
15007 spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was
15008 still more strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely
15009 paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled
15010 ships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple
15011 sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not
15012 possibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional
15013 timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though
15014 banding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the
15015 West have fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human
15016 beings, how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre’s pit,
15017 they will, at the slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the
15018 outlets, crowding, trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each
15019 other to death. Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the
15020 strangely gallied whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts
15021 of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.
15022 
15023 Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,
15024 yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor
15025 retreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in
15026 those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one lone
15027 whale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes’ time,
15028 Queequeg’s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray
15029 in our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered
15030 straight for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part
15031 of the whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise
15032 unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated;
15033 yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the
15034 fishery. For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the
15035 frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a
15036 delirious throb.
15037 
15038 As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of
15039 speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we
15040 thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by
15041 the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was
15042 like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer
15043 through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what
15044 moment it may be locked in and crushed.
15045 
15046 But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off
15047 from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away
15048 from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the
15049 time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our
15050 way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no
15051 time to make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their
15052 wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to
15053 the shouting part of the business. “Out of the way, Commodore!” cried
15054 one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface,
15055 and for an instant threatened to swamp us. “Hard down with your tail,
15056 there!” cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed
15057 calmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.
15058 
15059 All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented
15060 by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of
15061 equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each
15062 other’s grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is then
15063 attached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the line
15064 being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is
15065 chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then, more
15066 whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But
15067 sperm whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you
15068 must kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you
15069 must wing them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure.
15070 Hence it is, that at times like these the drugg, comes into
15071 requisition. Our boat was furnished with three of them. The first and
15072 second were successfully darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly
15073 running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing
15074 drugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball. But
15075 upon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy
15076 wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in an
15077 instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the
15078 boat’s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea
15079 came in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and
15080 shirts in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.
15081 
15082 It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it
15083 not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale’s way greatly
15084 diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from
15085 the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So
15086 that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale
15087 sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting
15088 momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the
15089 shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene
15090 valley lake. Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost
15091 whales, were heard but not felt. In this central expanse the sea
15092 presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by
15093 the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods.
15094 Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the
15095 heart of every commotion. And still in the distracted distance we
15096 beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw successive
15097 pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and round,
15098 like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to
15099 shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the
15100 middle ones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing to the
15101 density of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding
15102 the embayed axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at
15103 present afforded us. We must watch for a breach in the living wall that
15104 hemmed us in; the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us
15105 up. Keeping at the centre of the lake, we were occasionally visited by
15106 small tame cows and calves; the women and children of this routed host.
15107 
15108 Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving
15109 outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in
15110 any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by
15111 the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square
15112 miles. At any rate—though indeed such a test at such a time might be
15113 deceptive—spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed
15114 playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this
15115 circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely
15116 locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd
15117 had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its
15118 stopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way
15119 innocent and inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller
15120 whales—now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the
15121 lake—evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still
15122 becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like
15123 household dogs they came snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales,
15124 and touching them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly
15125 domesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched
15126 their backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the
15127 time refrained from darting it.
15128 
15129 But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still
15130 stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended
15131 in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the
15132 whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become
15133 mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth
15134 exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will
15135 calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two
15136 different lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment,
15137 be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;—even so
15138 did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at
15139 us, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight.
15140 Floating on their sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One
15141 of these little infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a
15142 day old, might have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six
15143 feet in girth. He was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed
15144 scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately
15145 occupied in the maternal reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready
15146 for the final spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar’s bow.
15147 The delicate side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly
15148 retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby’s ears newly arrived
15149 from foreign parts.
15150 
15151 “Line! line!” cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; “him fast! him
15152 fast!—Who line him! Who struck?—Two whale; one big, one little!”
15153 
15154 “What ails ye, man?” cried Starbuck.
15155 
15156 “Look-e here,” said Queequeg, pointing down.
15157 
15158 As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds
15159 of fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and
15160 shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling
15161 towards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord
15162 of Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to
15163 its dam. Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this
15164 natural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the
15165 hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest
15166 secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We
15167 saw young Leviathan amours in the deep.*
15168 
15169 *The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but
15170 unlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a
15171 gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but
15172 one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an
15173 Esau and Jacob:—a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats,
15174 curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts
15175 themselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious
15176 parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter’s lance, the mother’s
15177 pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk
15178 is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well
15179 with strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales
15180 salute _more hominum_.
15181 
15182 And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and
15183 affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and
15184 fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled
15185 in dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of
15186 my being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm;
15187 and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down
15188 and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.
15189 
15190 Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic
15191 spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,
15192 still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or
15193 possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance
15194 of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight
15195 of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro
15196 across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is
15197 sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful
15198 and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or
15199 maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled
15200 cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A
15201 whale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in this part, but not
15202 effectually, as it seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying
15203 along with him half of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony
15204 of the wound, he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the
15205 lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying
15206 dismay wherever he went.
15207 
15208 But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling
15209 spectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed
15210 to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first
15211 the intervening distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived
15212 that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale
15213 had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run
15214 away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope
15215 attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the
15216 harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose
15217 from his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was now churning
15218 through the water, violently flailing with his flexible tail, and
15219 tossing the keen spade about him, wounding and murdering his own
15220 comrades.
15221 
15222 This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their
15223 stationary fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake
15224 began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by
15225 half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to
15226 heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished;
15227 in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central
15228 circles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was
15229 departing. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the
15230 tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in
15231 Spring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner
15232 centre, as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly
15233 Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck taking the stern.
15234 
15235 “Oars! Oars!” he intensely whispered, seizing the helm—“gripe your
15236 oars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off,
15237 you Queequeg—the whale there!—prick him!—hit him! Stand up—stand up,
15238 and stay so! Spring, men—pull, men; never mind their backs—scrape
15239 them!—scrape away!”
15240 
15241 The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a
15242 narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate
15243 endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way
15244 rapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet.
15245 After many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into
15246 what had just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random
15247 whales, all violently making for one centre. This lucky salvation was
15248 cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg’s hat, who, while standing in
15249 the bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his
15250 head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad
15251 flukes close by.
15252 
15253 Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon
15254 resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having
15255 clumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their
15256 onward flight with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless;
15257 but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged
15258 whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask
15259 had killed and waifed. The waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of
15260 which are carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is at
15261 hand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both
15262 to mark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession,
15263 should the boats of any other ship draw near.
15264 
15265 The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious
15266 saying in the Fishery,—the more whales the less fish. Of all the
15267 drugged whales only one was captured. The rest contrived to escape for
15268 the time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some
15269 other craft than the Pequod.
15270 
15271 
15272 CHAPTER 88. Schools and Schoolmasters.
15273 
15274 The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm
15275 Whales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those
15276 vast aggregations.
15277 
15278 Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must
15279 have been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are
15280 occasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each.
15281 Such bands are known as schools. They generally are of two sorts; those
15282 composed almost entirely of females, and those mustering none but young
15283 vigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly designated.
15284 
15285 In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a
15286 male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces
15287 his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his
15288 ladies. In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about
15289 over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and
15290 endearments of the harem. The contrast between this Ottoman and his
15291 concubines is striking; because, while he is always of the largest
15292 leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not more
15293 than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They are
15294 comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen
15295 yards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the
15296 whole they are hereditarily entitled to _en bon point_.
15297 
15298 It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent
15299 ramblings. Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in
15300 leisurely search of variety. You meet them on the Line in time for the
15301 full flower of the Equatorial feeding season, having just returned,
15302 perhaps, from spending the summer in the Northern seas, and so cheating
15303 summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth. By the time they have
15304 lounged up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile, they start for
15305 the Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there, and so
15306 evade the other excessive temperature of the year.
15307 
15308 When serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange
15309 suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his
15310 interesting family. Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan
15311 coming that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the
15312 ladies, with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases
15313 him away! High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are
15314 to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though do
15315 what the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out of
15316 his bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often
15317 cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers; just so with
15318 the whales, who sometimes come to deadly battle, and all for love. They
15319 fence with their long lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and
15320 so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their
15321 antlers. Not a few are captured having the deep scars of these
15322 encounters,—furrowed heads, broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some
15323 instances, wrenched and dislocated mouths.
15324 
15325 But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at
15326 the first rush of the harem’s lord, then is it very diverting to watch
15327 that lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and
15328 revels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario,
15329 like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines.
15330 Granting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen will seldom give
15331 chase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand Turks are too lavish
15332 of their strength, and hence their unctuousness is small. As for the
15333 sons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons and daughters must
15334 take care of themselves; at least, with only the maternal help. For
15335 like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named, my
15336 Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery, however much for the bower;
15337 and so, being a great traveller, he leaves his anonymous babies all
15338 over the world; every baby an exotic. In good time, nevertheless, as
15339 the ardour of youth declines; as years and dumps increase; as
15340 reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a general lassitude
15341 overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the
15342 love for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent, repentant,
15343 admonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands the harem, and grown to
15344 an exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all alone among the meridians
15345 and parallels saying his prayers, and warning each young Leviathan from
15346 his amorous errors.
15347 
15348 Now, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so is
15349 the lord and master of that school technically known as the
15350 schoolmaster. It is therefore not in strict character, however
15351 admirably satirical, that after going to school himself, he should then
15352 go abroad inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly of it.
15353 His title, schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived from the
15354 name bestowed upon the harem itself, but some have surmised that the
15355 man who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale, must have read
15356 the memoirs of Vidocq, and informed himself what sort of a
15357 country-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his younger days, and
15358 what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of
15359 his pupils.
15360 
15361 The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale
15362 betakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm
15363 Whales. Almost universally, a lone whale—as a solitary Leviathan is
15364 called—proves an ancient one. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone,
15365 he will have no one near him but Nature herself; and her he takes to
15366 wife in the wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she is, though
15367 she keeps so many moody secrets.
15368 
15369 The schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously
15370 mentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools. For while
15371 those female whales are characteristically timid, the young males, or
15372 forty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious
15373 of all Leviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter;
15374 excepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met,
15375 and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout.
15376 
15377 The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools. Like a
15378 mob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness,
15379 tumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no
15380 prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous
15381 lad at Yale or Harvard. They soon relinquish this turbulence though,
15382 and when about three-fourths grown, break up, and separately go about
15383 in quest of settlements, that is, harems.
15384 
15385 Another point of difference between the male and female schools is
15386 still more characteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a
15387 Forty-barrel-bull—poor devil! all his comrades quit him. But strike a
15388 member of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with
15389 every token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long, as
15390 themselves to fall a prey.
15391 
15392 
15393 CHAPTER 89. Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish.
15394 
15395 The allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,
15396 necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale
15397 fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.
15398 
15399 It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company,
15400 a whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed
15401 and captured by another vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised
15402 many minor contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature. For
15403 example,—after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale, the
15404 body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and
15405 drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a
15406 calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line. Thus the
15407 most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the
15408 fishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal,
15409 undisputed law applicable to all cases.
15410 
15411 Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative
15412 enactment, was that of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in
15413 A.D. 1695. But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling
15414 law, yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and
15415 lawyers in this matter. They have provided a system which for terse
15416 comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian’s Pandects and the By-laws of the
15417 Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with other People’s
15418 Business. Yes; these laws might be engraven on a Queen Anne’s farthing,
15419 or the barb of a harpoon, and worn round the neck, so small are they.
15420 
15421 I. A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.
15422 
15423 II. A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.
15424 
15425 But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable
15426 brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to
15427 expound it.
15428 
15429 First: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast,
15430 when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at
15431 all controllable by the occupant or occupants,—a mast, an oar, a
15432 nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the
15433 same. Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any
15434 other recognised symbol of possession; so long as the party waifing it
15435 plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well
15436 as their intention so to do.
15437 
15438 These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen
15439 themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks—the
15440 Coke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more upright and
15441 honorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases, where
15442 it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim
15443 possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party. But
15444 others are by no means so scrupulous.
15445 
15446 Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated
15447 in England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of
15448 a whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had
15449 succeeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of
15450 their lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat
15451 itself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship) came up
15452 with the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it
15453 before the very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were
15454 remonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs’
15455 teeth, and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had
15456 done, he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had
15457 remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure. Wherefore
15458 the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale,
15459 line, harpoons, and boat.
15460 
15461 Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the
15462 judge. In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to
15463 illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case,
15464 wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife’s
15465 viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in
15466 the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to
15467 recover possession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he then
15468 supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally
15469 harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of
15470 the great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned
15471 her; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and
15472 therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then
15473 became that subsequent gentleman’s property, along with whatever
15474 harpoon might have been found sticking in her.
15475 
15476 Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the
15477 whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.
15478 
15479 These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very
15480 learned judge in set terms decided, to wit,—That as for the boat, he
15481 awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to
15482 save their lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale,
15483 harpoons, and line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because
15484 it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons
15485 and line because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish)
15486 acquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards
15487 took the fish had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took
15488 the fish; ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs.
15489 
15490 A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might
15491 possibly object to it. But ploughed up to the primary rock of the
15492 matter, the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws
15493 previously quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in
15494 the above cited case; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish,
15495 I say, will, on reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human
15496 jurisprudence; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of
15497 sculpture, the Temple of the Law, like the Temple of the Philistines,
15498 has but two props to stand on.
15499 
15500 Is it not a saying in every one’s mouth, Possession is half of the law:
15501 that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But often
15502 possession is the whole of the law. What are the sinews and souls of
15503 Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof possession
15504 is the whole of the law? What to the rapacious landlord is the widow’s
15505 last mite but a Fast-Fish? What is yonder undetected villain’s marble
15506 mansion with a door-plate for a waif; what is that but a Fast-Fish?
15507 What is the ruinous discount which Mordecai, the broker, gets from poor
15508 Woebegone, the bankrupt, on a loan to keep Woebegone’s family from
15509 starvation; what is that ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish? What is the
15510 Archbishop of Savesoul’s income of £100,000 seized from the scant bread
15511 and cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers (all sure
15512 of heaven without any of Savesoul’s help) what is that globular
15513 £100,000 but a Fast-Fish? What are the Duke of Dunder’s hereditary
15514 towns and hamlets but Fast-Fish? What to that redoubted harpooneer,
15515 John Bull, is poor Ireland, but a Fast-Fish? What to that apostolic
15516 lancer, Brother Jonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all
15517 these, is not Possession the whole of the law?
15518 
15519 But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the
15520 kindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so. That is
15521 internationally and universally applicable.
15522 
15523 What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck the
15524 Spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and
15525 mistress? What was Poland to the Czar? What Greece to the Turk? What
15526 India to England? What at last will Mexico be to the United States? All
15527 Loose-Fish.
15528 
15529 What are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but
15530 Loose-Fish? What all men’s minds and opinions but Loose-Fish? What is
15531 the principle of religious belief in them but a Loose-Fish? What to the
15532 ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but
15533 Loose-Fish? What is the great globe itself but a Loose-Fish? And what
15534 are you, reader, but a Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish, too?
15535 
15536 
15537 CHAPTER 90. Heads or Tails.
15538 
15539 “De balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam.”
15540 _Bracton, l. 3, c. 3._
15541 
15542 Latin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with the
15543 context, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of
15544 that land, the King, as Honorary Grand Harpooneer, must have the head,
15545 and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail. A division
15546 which, in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is no
15547 intermediate remainder. Now as this law, under a modified form, is to
15548 this day in force in England; and as it offers in various respects a
15549 strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and Loose-Fish, it is
15550 here treated of in a separate chapter, on the same courteous principle
15551 that prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a separate
15552 car, specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty. In the first
15553 place, in curious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is
15554 still in force, I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that
15555 happened within the last two years.
15556 
15557 It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one
15558 of the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and
15559 beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from
15560 the shore. Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the
15561 jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord Warden.
15562 Holding the office directly from the crown, I believe, all the royal
15563 emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become by assignment
15564 his. By some writers this office is called a sinecure. But not so.
15565 Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his
15566 perquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of
15567 them.
15568 
15569 Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their
15570 trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their
15571 fat fish high and dry, promising themselves a good £150 from the
15572 precious oil and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their
15573 wives, and good ale with their cronies, upon the strength of their
15574 respective shares; up steps a very learned and most Christian and
15575 charitable gentleman, with a copy of Blackstone under his arm; and
15576 laying it upon the whale’s head, he says—“Hands off! this fish, my
15577 masters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize it as the Lord Warden’s.” Upon this
15578 the poor mariners in their respectful consternation—so truly
15579 English—knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching their
15580 heads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the
15581 stranger. But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften the
15582 hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone. At
15583 length one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas, made
15584 bold to speak,
15585 
15586 “Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?”
15587 
15588 “The Duke.”
15589 
15590 “But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?”
15591 
15592 “It is his.”
15593 
15594 “We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is all
15595 that to go to the Duke’s benefit; we getting nothing at all for our
15596 pains but our blisters?”
15597 
15598 “It is his.”
15599 
15600 “Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of
15601 getting a livelihood?”
15602 
15603 “It is his.”
15604 
15605 “I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of
15606 this whale.”
15607 
15608 “It is his.”
15609 
15610 “Won’t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?”
15611 
15612 “It is his.”
15613 
15614 In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of
15615 Wellington received the money. Thinking that viewed in some particular
15616 lights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be
15617 deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman
15618 of the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace, begging him to
15619 take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration. To
15620 which my Lord Duke in substance replied (both letters were published)
15621 that he had already done so, and received the money, and would be
15622 obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he (the reverend
15623 gentleman) would decline meddling with other people’s business. Is this
15624 the still militant old man, standing at the corners of the three
15625 kingdoms, on all hands coercing alms of beggars?
15626 
15627 It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke
15628 to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs
15629 inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested
15630 with that right. The law itself has already been set forth. But Plowdon
15631 gives us the reason for it. Says Plowdon, the whale so caught belongs
15632 to the King and Queen, “because of its superior excellence.” And by the
15633 soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such
15634 matters.
15635 
15636 But why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail? A reason
15637 for that, ye lawyers!
15638 
15639 In his treatise on “Queen-Gold,” or Queen-pinmoney, an old King’s Bench
15640 author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: “Ye tail is ye Queen’s,
15641 that ye Queen’s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone.” Now this
15642 was written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or
15643 Right whale was largely used in ladies’ bodices. But this same bone is
15644 not in the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for a
15645 sagacious lawyer like Prynne. But is the Queen a mermaid, to be
15646 presented with a tail? An allegorical meaning may lurk here.
15647 
15648 There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers—the whale
15649 and the sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations, and
15650 nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown’s ordinary revenue. I
15651 know not that any other author has hinted of the matter; but by
15652 inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same
15653 way as the whale, the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head
15654 peculiar to that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly be
15655 humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality. And thus there
15656 seems a reason in all things, even in law.
15657 
15658 
15659 CHAPTER 91. The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.
15660 
15661 “In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this
15662 Leviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry.” _Sir T. Browne,
15663 V.E._
15664 
15665 It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when
15666 we were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, that the
15667 many noses on the Pequod’s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than
15668 the three pairs of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell
15669 was smelt in the sea.
15670 
15671 “I will bet something now,” said Stubb, “that somewhere hereabouts are
15672 some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought they
15673 would keel up before long.”
15674 
15675 Presently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance
15676 lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must
15677 be alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours
15678 from his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that
15679 circled, and hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the
15680 whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that
15681 is, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an
15682 unappropriated corpse. It may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor
15683 such a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague,
15684 when the living are incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable
15685 indeed is it regarded by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to
15686 moor alongside of it. Yet are there those who will still do it;
15687 notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of
15688 a very inferior quality, and by no means of the nature of
15689 attar-of-rose.
15690 
15691 Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman
15692 had a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of
15693 a nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of those
15694 problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of
15695 prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies
15696 almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the
15697 proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up
15698 his nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun blasted
15699 whales in general.
15700 
15701 The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he
15702 recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were
15703 knotted round the tail of one of these whales.
15704 
15705 “There’s a pretty fellow, now,” he banteringly laughed, standing in the
15706 ship’s bows, “there’s a jackal for ye! I well know that these Crappoes
15707 of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering
15708 their boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes,
15709 and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of
15710 tallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they
15711 will get won’t be enough to dip the Captain’s wick into; aye, we all
15712 know these things; but look ye, here’s a Crappo that is content with
15713 our leavings, the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too
15714 with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there.
15715 Poor devil! I say, pass round a hat, some one, and let’s make him a
15716 present of a little oil for dear charity’s sake. For what oil he’ll get
15717 from that drugged whale there, wouldn’t be fit to burn in a jail; no,
15718 not in a condemned cell. And as for the other whale, why, I’ll agree to
15719 get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours,
15720 than he’ll get from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of
15721 it, it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes,
15722 ambergris. I wonder now if our old man has thought of that. It’s worth
15723 trying. Yes, I’m for it;” and so saying he started for the
15724 quarter-deck.
15725 
15726 By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether
15727 or no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope
15728 of escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin,
15729 Stubb now called his boat’s crew, and pulled off for the stranger.
15730 Drawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the
15731 fanciful French taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in
15732 the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for
15733 thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole
15734 terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon
15735 her head boards, in large gilt letters, he read “Bouton de
15736 Rose,”—Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name of this
15737 aromatic ship.
15738 
15739 Though Stubb did not understand the _Bouton_ part of the inscription,
15740 yet the word _rose_, and the bulbous figure-head put together,
15741 sufficiently explained the whole to him.
15742 
15743 “A wooden rose-bud, eh?” he cried with his hand to his nose, “that will
15744 do very well; but how like all creation it smells!”
15745 
15746 Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he
15747 had to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close
15748 to the blasted whale; and so talk over it.
15749 
15750 Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he
15751 bawled—“Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that
15752 speak English?”
15753 
15754 “Yes,” rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be
15755 the chief-mate.
15756 
15757 “Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?”
15758 
15759 “_What_ whale?”
15760 
15761 “The _White_ Whale—a Sperm Whale—Moby Dick, have ye seen him?
15762 
15763 “Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale—no.”
15764 
15765 “Very good, then; good bye now, and I’ll call again in a minute.”
15766 
15767 Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning
15768 over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two
15769 hands into a trumpet and shouted—“No, Sir! No!” Upon which Ahab
15770 retired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman.
15771 
15772 He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the
15773 chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of
15774 bag.
15775 
15776 “What’s the matter with your nose, there?” said Stubb. “Broke it?”
15777 
15778 “I wish it was broken, or that I didn’t have any nose at all!” answered
15779 the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very
15780 much. “But what are you holding _yours_ for?”
15781 
15782 “Oh, nothing! It’s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain’t
15783 it? Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will
15784 ye, Bouton-de-Rose?”
15785 
15786 “What in the devil’s name do you want here?” roared the Guernseyman,
15787 flying into a sudden passion.
15788 
15789 “Oh! keep cool—cool? yes, that’s the word! why don’t you pack those
15790 whales in ice while you’re working at ’em? But joking aside, though; do
15791 you know, Rose-bud, that it’s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of
15792 such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn’t a gill in his
15793 whole carcase.”
15794 
15795 “I know that well enough; but, d’ye see, the Captain here won’t believe
15796 it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But
15797 come aboard, and mayhap he’ll believe you, if he won’t me; and so I’ll
15798 get out of this dirty scrape.”
15799 
15800 “Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,” rejoined Stubb,
15801 and with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene
15802 presented itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were
15803 getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked
15804 rather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good
15805 humor. All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many
15806 jib-booms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and run up
15807 to the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch
15808 the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their
15809 nostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short
15810 off at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it
15811 constantly filled their olfactories.
15812 
15813 Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from
15814 the Captain’s round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a
15815 fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from
15816 within. This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain
15817 remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself
15818 to the Captain’s round-house (_cabinet_ he called it) to avoid the
15819 pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and
15820 indignations at times.
15821 
15822 Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the
15823 Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate
15824 expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who
15825 had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle.
15826 Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man
15827 had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore
15828 held his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and
15829 confidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little plan
15830 for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain, without his at all
15831 dreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According to this little plan
15832 of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an interpreter’s office,
15833 was to tell the Captain what he pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and
15834 as for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost
15835 in him during the interview.
15836 
15837 By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a
15838 small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with
15839 large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet
15840 vest with watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now
15841 politely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put
15842 on the aspect of interpreting between them.
15843 
15844 “What shall I say to him first?” said he.
15845 
15846 “Why,” said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, “you
15847 may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me,
15848 though I don’t pretend to be a judge.”
15849 
15850 “He says, Monsieur,” said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his
15851 captain, “that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain
15852 and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a
15853 blasted whale they had brought alongside.”
15854 
15855 Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.
15856 
15857 “What now?” said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.
15858 
15859 “Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him
15860 carefully, I’m quite certain that he’s no more fit to command a
15861 whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he’s a
15862 baboon.”
15863 
15864 “He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one,
15865 is far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he conjures
15866 us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.”
15867 
15868 Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his
15869 crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast
15870 loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.
15871 
15872 “What now?” said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to
15873 them.
15874 
15875 “Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that—that—in fact,
15876 tell him I’ve diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody
15877 else.”
15878 
15879 “He says, Monsieur, that he’s very happy to have been of any service to
15880 us.”
15881 
15882 Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties
15883 (meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into
15884 his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.
15885 
15886 “He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,” said the interpreter.
15887 
15888 “Thank him heartily; but tell him it’s against my principles to drink
15889 with the man I’ve diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.”
15890 
15891 “He says, Monsieur, that his principles won’t admit of his drinking;
15892 but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur
15893 had best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales,
15894 for it’s so calm they won’t drift.”
15895 
15896 By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed
15897 the Guernsey-man to this effect,—that having a long tow-line in his
15898 boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the
15899 lighter whale of the two from the ship’s side. While the Frenchman’s
15900 boats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb
15901 benevolently towed away at his whale the other way, ostentatiously
15902 slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.
15903 
15904 Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;
15905 hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while
15906 the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb’s whale. Whereupon Stubb
15907 quickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to give
15908 notice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his
15909 unrighteous cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an
15910 excavation in the body, a little behind the side fin. You would almost
15911 have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at
15912 length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up
15913 old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam. His boat’s crew
15914 were all in high excitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking
15915 as anxious as gold-hunters.
15916 
15917 And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and
15918 screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning
15919 to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased,
15920 when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a
15921 faint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells
15922 without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then
15923 along with another, without at all blending with it for a time.
15924 
15925 “I have it, I have it,” cried Stubb, with delight, striking something
15926 in the subterranean regions, “a purse! a purse!”
15927 
15928 Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of
15929 something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old
15930 cheese; very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily dent it with
15931 your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this,
15932 good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any
15933 druggist. Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably
15934 lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were
15935 it not for impatient Ahab’s loud command to Stubb to desist, and come
15936 on board, else the ship would bid them good bye.
15937 
15938 
15939 CHAPTER 92. Ambergris.
15940 
15941 Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an
15942 article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain
15943 Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that
15944 subject. For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day,
15945 the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem
15946 to the learned. Though the word ambergris is but the French compound
15947 for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. For amber,
15948 though at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far
15949 inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea.
15950 Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance,
15951 used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris
15952 is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely
15953 used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and
15954 pomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for
15955 the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter’s in Rome.
15956 Some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.
15957 
15958 Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should
15959 regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a
15960 sick whale! Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the
15961 cause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to
15962 cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering
15963 three or four boat loads of Brandreth’s pills, and then running out of
15964 harm’s way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.
15965 
15966 I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,
15967 certain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be
15968 sailors’ trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were
15969 nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner.
15970 
15971 Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be
15972 found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that
15973 saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption;
15974 how that we are sown in dishonor, but raised in glory. And likewise
15975 call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the
15976 best musk. Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of
15977 ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is
15978 the worst.
15979 
15980 I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but
15981 cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against
15982 whalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds,
15983 might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said
15984 of the Frenchman’s two whales. Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous
15985 aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling is
15986 throughout a slatternly, untidy business. But there is another thing to
15987 rebut. They hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this
15988 odious stigma originate?
15989 
15990 I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the
15991 Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because
15992 those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea
15993 as the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh
15994 blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks,
15995 and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those
15996 Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed,
15997 forbidding any other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking
15998 into the hold, and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the
15999 Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising
16000 from excavating an old city grave-yard, for the foundations of a
16001 Lying-in Hospital.
16002 
16003 I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be
16004 likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former
16005 times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which
16006 latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great
16007 work on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name imports
16008 (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to
16009 afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried
16010 out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a
16011 collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works
16012 were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But
16013 all this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a
16014 voyage of four years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with
16015 oil, does not, perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling
16016 out; and in the state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.
16017 The truth is, that living or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a
16018 species are by no means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be
16019 recognised, as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew
16020 in the company, by the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be
16021 otherwise than fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high
16022 health; taking abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it
16023 is true, seldom in the open air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm
16024 Whale’s flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented
16025 lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. What then shall I liken the
16026 Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude? Must it not be
16027 to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with myrrh,
16028 which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to Alexander the Great?
16029 
16030 
16031 CHAPTER 93. The Castaway.
16032 
16033 It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most
16034 significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod’s crew;
16035 an event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the sometimes
16036 madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying
16037 prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own.
16038 
16039 Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats.
16040 Some few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is
16041 to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale. As a general
16042 thing, these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising
16043 the boats’ crews. But if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy,
16044 or timorous wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a
16045 ship-keeper. It was so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by
16046 nick-name, Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before;
16047 ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so
16048 gloomy-jolly.
16049 
16050 In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and
16051 a white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven
16052 in one eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull
16053 and torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at
16054 bottom very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness
16055 peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays and
16056 festivities with finer, freer relish than any other race. For blacks,
16057 the year’s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five
16058 Fourth of Julys and New Year’s Days. Nor smile so, while I write that
16059 this little black was brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy;
16060 behold yon lustrous ebony, panelled in king’s cabinets. But Pip loved
16061 life, and all life’s peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking
16062 business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had
16063 most sadly blurred his brightness; though, as ere long will be seen,
16064 what was thus temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be
16065 luridly illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him
16066 off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland
16067 County in Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler’s frolic on
16068 the green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned
16069 the round horizon into one star-belled tambourine. So, though in the
16070 clear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the
16071 pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning
16072 jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he
16073 lays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the sun,
16074 but by some unnatural gases. Then come out those fiery effulgences,
16075 infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once the divinest
16076 symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel stolen from
16077 the King of Hell. But let us to the story.
16078 
16079 It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb’s after-oarsman
16080 chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;
16081 and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.
16082 
16083 The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;
16084 but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and
16085 therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing
16086 him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness
16087 to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.
16088 
16089 Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as
16090 the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which
16091 happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip’s seat. The
16092 involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in
16093 hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale
16094 line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as
16095 to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water. That
16096 instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly
16097 straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of
16098 the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken
16099 several turns around his chest and neck.
16100 
16101 Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He
16102 hated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he
16103 suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,
16104 exclaimed interrogatively, “Cut?” Meantime Pip’s blue, choked face
16105 plainly looked, Do, for God’s sake! All passed in a flash. In less than
16106 half a minute, this entire thing happened.
16107 
16108 “Damn him, cut!” roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was
16109 saved.
16110 
16111 So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by
16112 yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these
16113 irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like,
16114 but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done,
16115 unofficially gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never
16116 jump from a boat, Pip, except—but all the rest was indefinite, as the
16117 soundest advice ever is. Now, in general, _Stick to the boat_, is your
16118 true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when _Leap from
16119 the boat_, is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if
16120 he should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be
16121 leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly
16122 dropped all advice, and concluded with a peremptory command, “Stick to
16123 the boat, Pip, or by the Lord, I won’t pick you up if you jump; mind
16124 that. We can’t afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would
16125 sell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in
16126 mind, and don’t jump any more.” Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted,
16127 that though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal,
16128 which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.
16129 
16130 But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was
16131 under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this
16132 time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started
16133 to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller’s
16134 trunk. Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful,
16135 bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly
16136 stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater’s skin
16137 hammered out to the extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip’s
16138 ebon head showed like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when
16139 he fell so rapidly astern. Stubb’s inexorable back was turned upon him;
16140 and the whale was winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless
16141 ocean was between Pip and Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor
16142 Pip turned his crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely
16143 castaway, though the loftiest and the brightest.
16144 
16145 Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the
16146 practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful
16147 lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the
16148 middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark,
16149 how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea—mark how closely
16150 they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.
16151 
16152 But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No;
16153 he did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake,
16154 and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip
16155 very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations
16156 towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always
16157 manifested by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances
16158 not unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so
16159 called, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to
16160 military navies and armies.
16161 
16162 But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly
16163 spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and
16164 Stubb’s boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent
16165 upon his fish, that Pip’s ringed horizon began to expand around him
16166 miserably. By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;
16167 but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot; such,
16168 at least, they said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body
16169 up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though.
16170 Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of
16171 the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes;
16172 and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the
16173 joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous,
16174 God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of waters
16175 heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God’s foot upon the treadle of the
16176 loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him mad. So
16177 man’s insanity is heaven’s sense; and wandering from all mortal reason,
16178 man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is
16179 absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised,
16180 indifferent as his God.
16181 
16182 For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is common in that
16183 fishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what
16184 like abandonment befell myself.
16185 
16186 
16187 CHAPTER 94. A Squeeze of the Hand.
16188 
16189 That whale of Stubb’s, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the
16190 Pequod’s side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations
16191 previously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling of
16192 the Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.
16193 
16194 While some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed in
16195 dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm; and
16196 when the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully manipulated
16197 ere going to the try-works, of which anon.
16198 
16199 It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with
16200 several others, I sat down before a large Constantine’s bath of it, I
16201 found it strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about
16202 in the liquid part. It was our business to squeeze these lumps back
16203 into fluid. A sweet and unctuous duty! No wonder that in old times this
16204 sperm was such a favourite cosmetic. Such a clearer! such a sweetener!
16205 such a softener! such a delicious molifier! After having my hands in it
16206 for only a few minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and began, as it
16207 were, to serpentine and spiralise.
16208 
16209 As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter
16210 exertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under
16211 indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands
16212 among those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost
16213 within the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and discharged all
16214 their opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as I snuffed up that
16215 uncontaminated aroma,—literally and truly, like the smell of spring
16216 violets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a musky
16217 meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible
16218 sperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to credit
16219 the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in
16220 allaying the heat of anger; while bathing in that bath, I felt divinely
16221 free from all ill-will, or petulance, or malice, of any sort
16222 whatsoever.
16223 
16224 Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm
16225 till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a
16226 strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly
16227 squeezing my co-laborers’ hands in it, mistaking their hands for the
16228 gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving
16229 feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually
16230 squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as
16231 much as to say,—Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish
16232 any social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come;
16233 let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into
16234 each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and
16235 sperm of kindness.
16236 
16237 Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since
16238 by many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all
16239 cases man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of
16240 attainable felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the
16241 fancy; but in the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the
16242 fireside, the country; now that I have perceived all this, I am ready
16243 to squeeze case eternally. In thoughts of the visions of the night, I
16244 saw long rows of angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of
16245 spermaceti.
16246 
16247 Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things
16248 akin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the
16249 try-works.
16250 
16251 First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering
16252 part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It
16253 is tough with congealed tendons—a wad of muscle—but still contains some
16254 oil. After being severed from the whale, the white-horse is first cut
16255 into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer. They look much like
16256 blocks of Berkshire marble.
16257 
16258 Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the
16259 whale’s flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and
16260 often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is
16261 a most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name
16262 imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked
16263 snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and
16264 purple. It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of reason,
16265 it is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I
16266 stole behind the foremast to try it. It tasted something as I should
16267 conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have
16268 tasted, supposing him to have been killed the first day after the
16269 venison season, and that particular venison season contemporary with an
16270 unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of Champagne.
16271 
16272 There is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in
16273 the course of this business, but which I feel it to be very puzzling
16274 adequately to describe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation
16275 original with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of the substance.
16276 It is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most frequently found in the
16277 tubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing, and subsequent decanting. I
16278 hold it to be the wondrously thin, ruptured membranes of the case,
16279 coalescing.
16280 
16281 Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but
16282 sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen. It designates the
16283 dark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the
16284 Greenland or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those
16285 inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.
16286 
16287 Nippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale’s
16288 vocabulary. But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman’s
16289 nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering
16290 part of Leviathan’s tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the
16291 rest, is about the size of the iron part of a hoe. Edgewise moved along
16292 the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameless
16293 blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all impurities.
16294 
16295 But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at
16296 once to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its
16297 inmates. This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for
16298 the blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale. When the
16299 proper time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment is a
16300 scene of terror to all tyros, especially by night. On one side, lit by
16301 a dull lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen. They
16302 generally go in pairs,—a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man. The
16303 whaling-pike is similar to a frigate’s boarding-weapon of the same
16304 name. The gaff is something like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the
16305 gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it from
16306 slipping, as the ship pitches and lurches about. Meanwhile, the
16307 spade-man stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it into
16308 the portable horse-pieces. This spade is sharp as hone can make it; the
16309 spademan’s feet are shoeless; the thing he stands on will sometimes
16310 irresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge. If he cuts off one of
16311 his own toes, or one of his assistants’, would you be very much
16312 astonished? Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room men.
16313 
16314 
16315 CHAPTER 95. The Cassock.
16316 
16317 Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this
16318 post-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the
16319 windlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small
16320 curiosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which you would have seen
16321 there, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers. Not the wondrous
16322 cistern in the whale’s huge head; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower
16323 jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail; none of these would so
16324 surprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone,—longer than
16325 a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at the base, and
16326 jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg. And an idol, indeed, it
16327 is; or, rather, in old times, its likeness was. Such an idol as that
16328 found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea; and for
16329 worshipping which, King Asa, her son, did depose her, and destroyed the
16330 idol, and burnt it for an abomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly
16331 set forth in the 15th chapter of the First Book of Kings.
16332 
16333 Look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and
16334 assisted by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the mariners
16335 call it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a
16336 grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field. Extending it upon the
16337 forecastle deck, he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt,
16338 as an African hunter the pelt of a boa. This done he turns the pelt
16339 inside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as
16340 almost to double its diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread, in
16341 the rigging, to dry. Ere long, it is taken down; when removing some
16342 three feet of it, towards the pointed extremity, and then cutting two
16343 slits for arm-holes at the other end, he lengthwise slips himself
16344 bodily into it. The mincer now stands before you invested in the full
16345 canonicals of his calling. Immemorial to all his order, this
16346 investiture alone will adequately protect him, while employed in the
16347 peculiar functions of his office.
16348 
16349 That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the
16350 pots; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse,
16351 planted endwise against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub beneath
16352 it, into which the minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets from a rapt
16353 orator’s desk. Arrayed in decent black; occupying a conspicuous pulpit;
16354 intent on bible leaves; what a candidate for an archbishopric, what a
16355 lad for a Pope were this mincer!*
16356 
16357 *Bible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry from the mates
16358 to the mincer. It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work into as
16359 thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of
16360 boiling out the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity considerably
16361 increased, besides perhaps improving it in quality.
16362 
16363 
16364 CHAPTER 96. The Try-Works.
16365 
16366 Besides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly
16367 distinguished by her try-works. She presents the curious anomaly of the
16368 most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the
16369 completed ship. It is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were
16370 transported to her planks.
16371 
16372 The try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the most
16373 roomy part of the deck. The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength,
16374 fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and
16375 mortar, some ten feet by eight square, and five in height. The
16376 foundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly
16377 secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all
16378 sides, and screwing it down to the timbers. On the flanks it is cased
16379 with wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping, battened
16380 hatchway. Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in
16381 number, and each of several barrels’ capacity. When not in use, they
16382 are kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they are polished with soapstone
16383 and sand, till they shine within like silver punch-bowls. During the
16384 night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil
16385 themselves away there for a nap. While employed in polishing them—one
16386 man in each pot, side by side—many confidential communications are
16387 carried on, over the iron lips. It is a place also for profound
16388 mathematical meditation. It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod,
16389 with the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was first
16390 indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies
16391 gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from
16392 any point in precisely the same time.
16393 
16394 Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare
16395 masonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of
16396 the furnaces, directly underneath the pots. These mouths are fitted
16397 with heavy doors of iron. The intense heat of the fire is prevented
16398 from communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow reservoir
16399 extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works. By a tunnel
16400 inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as
16401 fast as it evaporates. There are no external chimneys; they open direct
16402 from the rear wall. And here let us go back for a moment.
16403 
16404 It was about nine o’clock at night that the Pequod’s try-works were
16405 first started on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to oversee
16406 the business.
16407 
16408 “All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the
16409 works.” This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting
16410 his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said
16411 that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed
16412 for a time with wood. After that no wood is used, except as a means of
16413 quick ignition to the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out,
16414 the crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still
16415 contains considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters feed
16416 the flames. Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming
16417 misanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by
16418 his own body. Would that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is
16419 horrible to inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but you
16420 must live in it for the time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor
16421 about it, such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells
16422 like the left wing of the day of judgment; it is an argument for the
16423 pit.
16424 
16425 By midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the
16426 carcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean
16427 darkness was intense. But that darkness was licked up by the fierce
16428 flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and
16429 illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek
16430 fire. The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to
16431 some vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the
16432 bold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad
16433 sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates, and
16434 folded them in conflagrations.
16435 
16436 The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide
16437 hearth in front of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of
16438 the pagan harpooneers, always the whale-ship’s stokers. With huge
16439 pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding
16440 pots, or stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted,
16441 curling, out of the doors to catch them by the feet. The smoke rolled
16442 away in sullen heaps. To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of
16443 the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces.
16444 Opposite the mouth of the works, on the further side of the wide wooden
16445 hearth, was the windlass. This served for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the
16446 watch, when not otherwise employed, looking into the red heat of the
16447 fire, till their eyes felt scorched in their heads. Their tawny
16448 features, now all begrimed with smoke and sweat, their matted beards,
16449 and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were
16450 strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works. As they
16451 narrated to each other their unholy adventures, their tales of terror
16452 told in words of mirth; as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards
16453 out of them, like the flames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their
16454 front, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged
16455 forks and dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the
16456 ship groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further
16457 and further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully
16458 champed the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on
16459 all sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden
16460 with fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of
16461 darkness, seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander’s
16462 soul.
16463 
16464 So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently
16465 guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea. Wrapped, for that
16466 interval, in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness, the
16467 madness, the ghastliness of others. The continual sight of the fiend
16468 shapes before me, capering half in smoke and half in fire, these at
16469 last begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon as I began to yield to
16470 that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a
16471 midnight helm.
16472 
16473 But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable)
16474 thing occurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was
16475 horribly conscious of something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller
16476 smote my side, which leaned against it; in my ears was the low hum of
16477 sails, just beginning to shake in the wind; I thought my eyes were
16478 open; I was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and
16479 mechanically stretching them still further apart. But, spite of all
16480 this, I could see no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed
16481 but a minute since I had been watching the card, by the steady binnacle
16482 lamp illuminating it. Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and
16483 then made ghastly by flashes of redness. Uppermost was the impression,
16484 that whatever swift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to
16485 any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered
16486 feeling, as of death, came over me. Convulsively my hands grasped the
16487 tiller, but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in
16488 some enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is the matter with me?
16489 thought I. Lo! in my brief sleep I had turned myself about, and was
16490 fronting the ship’s stern, with my back to her prow and the compass. In
16491 an instant I faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying
16492 up into the wind, and very probably capsizing her. How glad and how
16493 grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night, and
16494 the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee!
16495 
16496 Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never dream with thy
16497 hand on the helm! Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first
16498 hint of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its
16499 redness makes all things look ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun,
16500 the skies will be bright; those who glared like devils in the forking
16501 flames, the morn will show in far other, at least gentler, relief; the
16502 glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true lamp—all others but liars!
16503 
16504 Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia’s Dismal Swamp, nor Rome’s
16505 accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of
16506 deserts and of griefs beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean,
16507 which is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this
16508 earth. So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow
16509 in him, that mortal man cannot be true—not true, or undeveloped. With
16510 books the same. The truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows, and the
16511 truest of all books is Solomon’s, and Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered
16512 steel of woe. “All is vanity.” ALL. This wilful world hath not got hold
16513 of unchristian Solomon’s wisdom yet. But he who dodges hospitals and
16514 jails, and walks fast crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of
16515 operas than hell; calls Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils
16516 all of sick men; and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais
16517 as passing wise, and therefore jolly;—not that man is fitted to sit
16518 down on tomb-stones, and break the green damp mould with unfathomably
16519 wondrous Solomon.
16520 
16521 But even Solomon, he says, “the man that wandereth out of the way of
16522 understanding shall remain” (_i.e._, even while living) “in the
16523 congregation of the dead.” Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it
16524 invert thee, deaden thee; as for the time it did me. There is a wisdom
16525 that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness. And there is a
16526 Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest
16527 gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny
16528 spaces. And even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is
16529 in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle
16530 is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.
16531 
16532 
16533 CHAPTER 97. The Lamp.
16534 
16535 Had you descended from the Pequod’s try-works to the Pequod’s
16536 forecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single
16537 moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some
16538 illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors. There they lay
16539 in their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled muteness; a
16540 score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes.
16541 
16542 In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of
16543 queens. To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in
16544 darkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he
16545 seeks the food of light, so he lives in light. He makes his berth an
16546 Aladdin’s lamp, and lays him down in it; so that in the pitchiest night
16547 the ship’s black hull still houses an illumination.
16548 
16549 See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of
16550 lamps—often but old bottles and vials, though—to the copper cooler at
16551 the try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a vat. He
16552 burns, too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and, therefore,
16553 unvitiated state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or astral
16554 contrivances ashore. It is sweet as early grass butter in April. He
16555 goes and hunts for his oil, so as to be sure of its freshness and
16556 genuineness, even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own
16557 supper of game.
16558 
16559 
16560 CHAPTER 98. Stowing Down and Clearing Up.
16561 
16562 Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off
16563 descried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors,
16564 and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed
16565 alongside and beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the
16566 headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his
16567 great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in
16568 due time, he is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach, and
16569 Abednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through the
16570 fire;—but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of
16571 the description by rehearsing—singing, if I may—the romantic proceeding
16572 of decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the
16573 hold, where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities,
16574 sliding along beneath the surface as before; but, alas! never more to
16575 rise and blow.
16576 
16577 While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the
16578 six-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling
16579 this way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed
16580 round and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously scoot
16581 across the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at last
16582 man-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the hoops, rap,
16583 rap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, _ex officio_,
16584 every sailor is a cooper.
16585 
16586 At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the
16587 great hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open,
16588 and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the
16589 hatches are replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled up.
16590 
16591 In the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable
16592 incidents in all the business of whaling. One day the planks stream
16593 with freshets of blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous
16594 masses of the whale’s head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie
16595 about, as in a brewery yard; the smoke from the try-works has besooted
16596 all the bulwarks; the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness; the
16597 entire ship seems great leviathan himself; while on all hands the din
16598 is deafening.
16599 
16600 But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this
16601 self-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works,
16602 you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a
16603 most scrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil
16604 possesses a singularly cleansing virtue. This is the reason why the
16605 decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of
16606 oil. Besides, from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a
16607 potent lye is readily made; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back
16608 of the whale remains clinging to the side, that lye quickly
16609 exterminates it. Hands go diligently along the bulwarks, and with
16610 buckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness. The soot
16611 is brushed from the lower rigging. All the numerous implements which
16612 have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away. The
16613 great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try-works, completely
16614 hiding the pots; every cask is out of sight; all tackles are coiled in
16615 unseen nooks; and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of
16616 almost the entire ship’s company, the whole of this conscientious duty
16617 is at last concluded, then the crew themselves proceed to their own
16618 ablutions; shift themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the
16619 immaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from
16620 out the daintiest Holland.
16621 
16622 Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and
16623 humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;
16624 propose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object not
16625 to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to
16626 such musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were little short
16627 of audacity. They know not the thing you distantly allude to. Away, and
16628 bring us napkins!
16629 
16630 But mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men intent
16631 on spying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will again soil
16632 the old oaken furniture, and drop at least one small grease-spot
16633 somewhere. Yes; and many is the time, when, after the severest
16634 uninterrupted labors, which know no night; continuing straight through
16635 for ninety-six hours; when from the boat, where they have swelled their
16636 wrists with all day rowing on the Line,—they only step to the deck to
16637 carry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass, and cut and slash,
16638 yea, and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the
16639 combined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works;
16640 when, on the heel of all this, they have finally bestirred themselves
16641 to cleanse the ship, and make a spotless dairy room of it; many is the
16642 time the poor fellows, just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks,
16643 are startled by the cry of “There she blows!” and away they fly to
16644 fight another whale, and go through the whole weary thing again. Oh! my
16645 friends, but this is man-killing! Yet this is life. For hardly have we
16646 mortals by long toilings extracted from this world’s vast bulk its
16647 small but valuable sperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed
16648 ourselves from its defilements, and learned to live here in clean
16649 tabernacles of the soul; hardly is this done, when—_There she
16650 blows!_—the ghost is spouted up, and away we sail to fight some other
16651 world, and go through young life’s old routine again.
16652 
16653 Oh! the metempsychosis! Oh! Pythagoras, that in bright Greece, two
16654 thousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed with
16655 thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage—and, foolish as I am, taught
16656 thee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope!
16657 
16658 
16659 CHAPTER 99. The Doubloon.
16660 
16661 Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck,
16662 taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but in
16663 the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been
16664 added how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood,
16665 he was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely
16666 eyeing the particular object before him. When he halted before the
16667 binnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the
16668 compass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of
16669 his purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the
16670 mainmast, then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted
16671 gold coin there, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only
16672 dashed with a certain wild longing, if not hopefulness.
16673 
16674 But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly
16675 attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as
16676 though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in
16677 some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them. And some
16678 certain significance lurks in all things, else all things are little
16679 worth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell
16680 by the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass
16681 in the Milky Way.
16682 
16683 Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of
16684 the heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands,
16685 the head-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst
16686 all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes,
16687 yet, untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its
16688 Quito glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour
16689 passed by ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with
16690 thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless
16691 every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it
16692 was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however
16693 wanton in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as
16694 the white whale’s talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary
16695 watch by night, wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he
16696 would ever live to spend it.
16697 
16698 Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun
16699 and tropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sun’s
16700 disks and stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving,
16701 are in luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold seems
16702 almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories, by
16703 passing through those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.
16704 
16705 It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy
16706 example of these things. On its round border it bore the letters,
16707 REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO. So this bright coin came from a country
16708 planted in the middle of the world, and beneath the great equator, and
16709 named after it; and it had been cast midway up the Andes, in the
16710 unwaning clime that knows no autumn. Zoned by those letters you saw the
16711 likeness of three Andes’ summits; from one a flame; a tower on another;
16712 on the third a crowing cock; while arching over all was a segment of
16713 the partitioned zodiac, the signs all marked with their usual
16714 cabalistics, and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at
16715 Libra.
16716 
16717 Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now
16718 pausing.
16719 
16720 “There’s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and
16721 all other grand and lofty things; look here,—three peaks as proud as
16722 Lucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the
16723 courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all
16724 are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe,
16725 which, like a magician’s glass, to each and every man in turn but
16726 mirrors back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains for
16727 those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself. Methinks
16728 now this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the
16729 sign of storms, the equinox! and but six months before he wheeled out
16730 of a former equinox at Aries! From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born
16731 in throes, ’tis fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs! So
16732 be it, then! Here’s stout stuff for woe to work on. So be it, then.”
16733 
16734 “No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil’s claws must
16735 have left their mouldings there since yesterday,” murmured Starbuck to
16736 himself, leaning against the bulwarks. “The old man seems to read
16737 Belshazzar’s awful writing. I have never marked the coin inspectingly.
16738 He goes below; let me read. A dark valley between three mighty,
16739 heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in some faint
16740 earthly symbol. So in this vale of Death, God girds us round; and over
16741 all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a
16742 hope. If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil;
16743 but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way, to
16744 cheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at midnight, we
16745 would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain!
16746 This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me. I will
16747 quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely.”
16748 
16749 “There now’s the old Mogul,” soliloquized Stubb by the try-works, “he’s
16750 been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and both with
16751 faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long.
16752 And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I have it now on
16753 Negro Hill or in Corlaer’s Hook, I’d not look at it very long ere
16754 spending it. Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion, I regard this as
16755 queer. I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings; your doubloons
16756 of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili, your
16757 doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of Popayan; with plenty of gold
16758 moidores and pistoles, and joes, and half joes, and quarter joes. What
16759 then should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so killing
16760 wonderful? By Golconda! let me read it once. Halloa! here’s signs and
16761 wonders truly! That, now, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the
16762 zodiac, and what my almanac below calls ditto. I’ll get the almanac and
16763 as I have heard devils can be raised with Daboll’s arithmetic, I’ll try
16764 my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the
16765 Massachusetts calendar. Here’s the book. Let’s see now. Signs and
16766 wonders; and the sun, he’s always among ’em. Hem, hem, hem; here they
16767 are—here they go—all alive:—Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull and
16768 Jimimi! here’s Gemini himself, or the Twins. Well; the sun he wheels
16769 among ’em. Aye, here on the coin he’s just crossing the threshold
16770 between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring. Book! you lie there;
16771 the fact is, you books must know your places. You’ll do to give us the
16772 bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the thoughts. That’s my
16773 small experience, so far as the Massachusetts calendar, and Bowditch’s
16774 navigator, and Daboll’s arithmetic go. Signs and wonders, eh? Pity if
16775 there is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant in wonders!
16776 There’s a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist—hark! By Jove, I have it!
16777 Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one round
16778 chapter; and now I’ll read it off, straight out of the book. Come,
16779 Almanack! To begin: there’s Aries, or the Ram—lecherous dog, he begets
16780 us; then, Taurus, or the Bull—he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini,
16781 or the Twins—that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo!
16782 comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue,
16783 Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path—he gives a few fierce bites and
16784 surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that’s
16785 our first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes
16786 Libra, or the Scales—happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we
16787 are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio, or the
16788 Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when whang
16789 come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing
16790 himself. As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here’s the
16791 battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing,
16792 and headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours
16793 out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the
16794 Fishes, we sleep. There’s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the
16795 sun goes through it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and
16796 hearty. Jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and
16797 so, alow here, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly’s the word for aye! Adieu,
16798 Doubloon! But stop; here comes little King-Post; dodge round the
16799 try-works, now, and let’s hear what he’ll have to say. There; he’s
16800 before it; he’ll out with something presently. So, so; he’s beginning.”
16801 
16802 “I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever raises
16803 a certain whale, this round thing belongs to him. So, what’s all this
16804 staring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars, that’s true; and at
16805 two cents the cigar, that’s nine hundred and sixty cigars. I won’t
16806 smoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and here’s nine
16807 hundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy ’em out.”
16808 
16809 “Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a
16810 foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of
16811 wiseish look to it. But, avast; here comes our old Manxman—the old
16812 hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea.
16813 He luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round on the other
16814 side of the mast; why, there’s a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and
16815 now he’s back again; what does that mean? Hark! he’s muttering—voice
16816 like an old worn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and listen!”
16817 
16818 “If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when
16819 the sun stands in some one of these signs. I’ve studied signs, and know
16820 their marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old witch
16821 in Copenhagen. Now, in what sign will the sun then be? The horse-shoe
16822 sign; for there it is, right opposite the gold. And what’s the
16823 horse-shoe sign? The lion is the horse-shoe sign—the roaring and
16824 devouring lion. Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to think of thee.”
16825 
16826 “There’s another rendering now; but still one text. All sorts of men in
16827 one kind of world, you see. Dodge again! here comes Queequeg—all
16828 tattooing—looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself. What says the
16829 Cannibal? As I live he’s comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone;
16830 thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I
16831 suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon’s Astronomy in the back country.
16832 And by Jove, he’s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh—I
16833 guess it’s Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he don’t know what to make
16834 of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some king’s
16835 trowsers. But, aside again! here comes that ghost-devil, Fedallah; tail
16836 coiled out of sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual.
16837 What does he say, with that look of his? Ah, only makes a sign to the
16838 sign and bows himself; there is a sun on the coin—fire worshipper,
16839 depend upon it. Ho! more and more. This way comes Pip—poor boy! would
16840 he had died, or I; he’s half horrible to me. He too has been watching
16841 all of these interpreters—myself included—and look now, he comes to
16842 read, with that unearthly idiot face. Stand away again and hear him.
16843 Hark!”
16844 
16845 “I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”
16846 
16847 “Upon my soul, he’s been studying Murray’s Grammar! Improving his mind,
16848 poor fellow! But what’s that he says now—hist!”
16849 
16850 “I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”
16851 
16852 “Why, he’s getting it by heart—hist! again.”
16853 
16854 “I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”
16855 
16856 “Well, that’s funny.”
16857 
16858 “And I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and I’m a
16859 crow, especially when I stand a’top of this pine tree here. Caw! caw!
16860 caw! caw! caw! caw! Ain’t I a crow? And where’s the scare-crow? There
16861 he stands; two bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers, and two more
16862 poked into the sleeves of an old jacket.”
16863 
16864 “Wonder if he means me?—complimentary!—poor lad!—I could go hang
16865 myself. Any way, for the present, I’ll quit Pip’s vicinity. I can stand
16866 the rest, for they have plain wits; but he’s too crazy-witty for my
16867 sanity. So, so, I leave him muttering.”
16868 
16869 “Here’s the ship’s navel, this doubloon here, and they are all on fire
16870 to unscrew it. But, unscrew your navel, and what’s the consequence?
16871 Then again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for when aught’s
16872 nailed to the mast it’s a sign that things grow desperate. Ha, ha! old
16873 Ahab! the White Whale; he’ll nail ye! This is a pine tree. My father,
16874 in old Tolland county, cut down a pine tree once, and found a silver
16875 ring grown over in it; some old darkey’s wedding ring. How did it get
16876 there? And so they’ll say in the resurrection, when they come to fish
16877 up this old mast, and find a doubloon lodged in it, with bedded oysters
16878 for the shaggy bark. Oh, the gold! the precious, precious, gold! the
16879 green miser’ll hoard ye soon! Hish! hish! God goes ’mong the worlds
16880 blackberrying. Cook! ho, cook! and cook us! Jenny! hey, hey, hey, hey,
16881 hey, Jenny, Jenny! and get your hoe-cake done!”
16882 
16883 
16884 CHAPTER 100. Leg and Arm.
16885 
16886 The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel Enderby, of London.
16887 
16888 “Ship, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?”
16889 
16890 So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours,
16891 bearing down under the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was
16892 standing in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to
16893 the stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boat’s
16894 bow. He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of
16895 sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round
16896 him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket
16897 streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar’s surcoat.
16898 
16899 “Hast seen the White Whale?”
16900 
16901 “See you this?” and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it,
16902 he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden
16903 head like a mallet.
16904 
16905 “Man my boat!” cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near
16906 him—“Stand by to lower!”
16907 
16908 In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his
16909 crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the
16910 stranger. But here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the
16911 excitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his
16912 leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his
16913 own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical
16914 contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and
16915 shipped in any other vessel at a moment’s warning. Now, it is no very
16916 easy matter for anybody—except those who are almost hourly used to it,
16917 like whalemen—to clamber up a ship’s side from a boat on the open sea;
16918 for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks,
16919 and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson. So,
16920 deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether
16921 unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now found himself abjectly
16922 reduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain
16923 changeful height he could hardly hope to attain.
16924 
16925 It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward
16926 circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his
16927 luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And
16928 in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the
16929 two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the
16930 perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a
16931 pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem
16932 to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to
16933 use their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute,
16934 because the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood,
16935 cried out, “I see, I see!—avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing
16936 over the cutting-tackle.”
16937 
16938 As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two
16939 previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive
16940 curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end.
16941 This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all,
16942 slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting
16943 in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then
16944 giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to
16945 hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running
16946 parts of the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high
16947 bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm
16948 frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab,
16949 putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two
16950 sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, “Aye, aye, hearty! let
16951 us shake bones together!—an arm and a leg!—an arm that never can
16952 shrink, d’ye see; and a leg that never can run. Where did’st thou see
16953 the White Whale?—how long ago?”
16954 
16955 “The White Whale,” said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards
16956 the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a
16957 telescope; “there I saw him, on the Line, last season.”
16958 
16959 “And he took that arm off, did he?” asked Ahab, now sliding down from
16960 the capstan, and resting on the Englishman’s shoulder, as he did so.
16961 
16962 “Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?”
16963 
16964 “Spin me the yarn,” said Ahab; “how was it?”
16965 
16966 “It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,”
16967 began the Englishman. “I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time.
16968 Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat
16969 fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went
16970 milling and milling round so, that my boat’s crew could only trim dish,
16971 by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches
16972 from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white
16973 head and hump, all crows’ feet and wrinkles.”
16974 
16975 “It was he, it was he!” cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended
16976 breath.
16977 
16978 “And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.”
16979 
16980 “Aye, aye—they were mine—_my_ irons,” cried Ahab, exultingly—“but on!”
16981 
16982 “Give me a chance, then,” said the Englishman, good-humoredly. “Well,
16983 this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all
16984 afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!
16985 
16986 “Aye, I see!—wanted to part it; free the fast-fish—an old trick—I know
16987 him.”
16988 
16989 “How it was exactly,” continued the one-armed commander, “I do not
16990 know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there
16991 somehow; but we didn’t know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled
16992 on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of the other
16993 whale’s; that went off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how matters
16994 stood, and what a noble great whale it was—the noblest and biggest I
16995 ever saw, sir, in my life—I resolved to capture him, spite of the
16996 boiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would
16997 get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a
16998 devil of a boat’s crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I
16999 say, I jumped into my first mate’s boat—Mr. Mounttop’s here (by the
17000 way, Captain—Mounttop; Mounttop—the captain);—as I was saying, I jumped
17001 into Mounttop’s boat, which, d’ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with
17002 mine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old
17003 great-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, sir—hearts and souls
17004 alive, man—the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat—both eyes
17005 out—all befogged and bedeadened with black foam—the whale’s tail
17006 looming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble
17007 steeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday,
17008 with a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after
17009 the second iron, to toss it overboard—down comes the tail like a Lima
17010 tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and,
17011 flukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was
17012 all chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I
17013 seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung
17014 to that like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at
17015 the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down
17016 like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near
17017 me caught me here” (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); “yes,
17018 caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hell’s flames, I was
17019 thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb
17020 ript its way along the flesh—clear along the whole length of my
17021 arm—came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;—and that gentleman there
17022 will tell you the rest (by the way, captain—Dr. Bunger, ship’s surgeon:
17023 Bunger, my lad,—the captain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the
17024 yarn.”
17025 
17026 The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all
17027 the time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote
17028 his gentlemanly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but
17029 sober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and
17030 patched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention between
17031 a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other,
17032 occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two
17033 crippled captains. But, at his superior’s introduction of him to Ahab,
17034 he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain’s bidding.
17035 
17036 “It was a shocking bad wound,” began the whale-surgeon; “and, taking my
17037 advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy—”
17038 
17039 “Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship,” interrupted the one-armed
17040 captain, addressing Ahab; “go on, boy.”
17041 
17042 “Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing
17043 hot weather there on the Line. But it was no use—I did all I could; sat
17044 up with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of diet—”
17045 
17046 “Oh, very severe!” chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly
17047 altering his voice, “Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till
17048 he couldn’t see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed, half
17049 seas over, about three o’clock in the morning. Oh, ye stars! he sat up
17050 with me indeed, and was very severe in my diet. Oh! a great watcher,
17051 and very dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you dog, laugh
17052 out! why don’t ye? You know you’re a precious jolly rascal.) But, heave
17053 ahead, boy, I’d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other
17054 man.”
17055 
17056 “My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir”—said the
17057 imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab—“is apt to
17058 be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that sort. But
17059 I may as well say—en passant, as the French remark—that I myself—that
17060 is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend clergy—am a strict total
17061 abstinence man; I never drink—”
17062 
17063 “Water!” cried the captain; “he never drinks it; it’s a sort of fits to
17064 him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on—go on with
17065 the arm story.”
17066 
17067 “Yes, I may as well,” said the surgeon, coolly. “I was about observing,
17068 sir, before Captain Boomer’s facetious interruption, that spite of my
17069 best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse;
17070 the truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw;
17071 more than two feet and several inches long. I measured it with the lead
17072 line. In short, it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it
17073 came. But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is
17074 against all rule”—pointing at it with the marlingspike—“that is the
17075 captain’s work, not mine; he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had
17076 that club-hammer there put to the end, to knock some one’s brains out
17077 with, I suppose, as he tried mine once. He flies into diabolical
17078 passions sometimes. Do ye see this dent, sir”—removing his hat, and
17079 brushing aside his hair, and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull,
17080 but which bore not the slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever
17081 having been a wound—“Well, the captain there will tell you how that
17082 came here; he knows.”
17083 
17084 “No, I don’t,” said the captain, “but his mother did; he was born with
17085 it. Oh, you solemn rogue, you—you Bunger! was there ever such another
17086 Bunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in
17087 pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal.”
17088 
17089 “What became of the White Whale?” now cried Ahab, who thus far had been
17090 impatiently listening to this by-play between the two Englishmen.
17091 
17092 “Oh!” cried the one-armed captain, “oh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we
17093 didn’t see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I
17094 didn’t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick,
17095 till some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard about
17096 Moby Dick—as some call him—and then I knew it was he.”
17097 
17098 “Did’st thou cross his wake again?”
17099 
17100 “Twice.”
17101 
17102 “But could not fasten?”
17103 
17104 “Didn’t want to try to: ain’t one limb enough? What should I do without
17105 this other arm? And I’m thinking Moby Dick doesn’t bite so much as he
17106 swallows.”
17107 
17108 “Well, then,” interrupted Bunger, “give him your left arm for bait to
17109 get the right. Do you know, gentlemen”—very gravely and mathematically
17110 bowing to each Captain in succession—“Do you know, gentlemen, that the
17111 digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine
17112 Providence, that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest
17113 even a man’s arm? And he knows it too. So that what you take for the
17114 White Whale’s malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means to
17115 swallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints. But
17116 sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of
17117 mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a
17118 time let one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a
17119 twelvemonth or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in
17120 small tacks, d’ye see. No possible way for him to digest that
17121 jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system.
17122 Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about it, and have a mind
17123 to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial
17124 to the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only let the whale
17125 have another chance at you shortly, that’s all.”
17126 
17127 “No, thank ye, Bunger,” said the English Captain, “he’s welcome to the
17128 arm he has, since I can’t help it, and didn’t know him then; but not to
17129 another one. No more White Whales for me; I’ve lowered for him once,
17130 and that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I
17131 know that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark
17132 ye, he’s best let alone; don’t you think so, Captain?”—glancing at the
17133 ivory leg.
17134 
17135 “He is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is best let
17136 alone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures. He’s all a
17137 magnet! How long since thou saw’st him last? Which way heading?”
17138 
17139 “Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend’s,” cried Bunger, stoopingly
17140 walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; “this man’s
17141 blood—bring the thermometer!—it’s at the boiling point!—his pulse makes
17142 these planks beat!—sir!”—taking a lancet from his pocket, and drawing
17143 near to Ahab’s arm.
17144 
17145 “Avast!” roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks—“Man the boat!
17146 Which way heading?”
17147 
17148 “Good God!” cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put.
17149 “What’s the matter? He was heading east, I think.—Is your Captain
17150 crazy?” whispering Fedallah.
17151 
17152 But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to
17153 take the boat’s steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle
17154 towards him, commanded the ship’s sailors to stand by to lower.
17155 
17156 In a moment he was standing in the boat’s stern, and the Manilla men
17157 were springing to their oars. In vain the English Captain hailed him.
17158 With back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own,
17159 Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod.
17160 
17161 
17162 CHAPTER 101. The Decanter.
17163 
17164 Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she
17165 hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby,
17166 merchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of
17167 Enderby & Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman’s opinion, comes not
17168 far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in point
17169 of real historical interest. How long, prior to the year of our Lord
17170 1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous
17171 fish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted out
17172 the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale;
17173 though for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our valiant
17174 Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets
17175 pursued that Leviathan, but only in the North and South Atlantic: not
17176 elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were
17177 the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm
17178 Whale; and that for half a century they were the only people of the
17179 whole globe who so harpooned him.
17180 
17181 In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose,
17182 and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape
17183 Horn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any
17184 sort in the great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one;
17185 and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm,
17186 the Amelia’s example was soon followed by other ships, English and
17187 American, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were
17188 thrown open. But not content with this good deed, the indefatigable
17189 house again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his Sons—how many, their
17190 mother only knows—and under their immediate auspices, and partly, I
17191 think, at their expense, the British government was induced to send the
17192 sloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South
17193 Sea. Commanded by a naval Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling
17194 voyage of it, and did some service; how much does not appear. But this
17195 is not all. In 1819, the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship
17196 of their own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan.
17197 That ship—well called the “Syren”—made a noble experimental cruise; and
17198 it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became
17199 generally known. The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a
17200 Captain Coffin, a Nantucketer.
17201 
17202 All honor to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists to
17203 the present day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago
17204 have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world.
17205 
17206 The ship named after him was worthy of the honor, being a very fast
17207 sailer and a noble craft every way. I boarded her once at midnight
17208 somewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the
17209 forecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumps—every
17210 soul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly death. And that fine
17211 gam I had—long, very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his
17212 ivory heel—it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of that
17213 ship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I ever
17214 lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we flipped it
17215 at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it’s
17216 squally off there by Patagonia), and all hands—visitors and all—were
17217 called to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each
17218 other aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our
17219 jackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the
17220 howling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts
17221 did not go overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that
17222 we had to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting
17223 down the forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to
17224 my taste.
17225 
17226 The beef was fine—tough, but with body in it. They said it was
17227 bull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for
17228 certain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial,
17229 symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. I fancied that
17230 you could feel them, and roll them about in you after they were
17231 swallowed. If you stooped over too far forward, you risked their
17232 pitching out of you like billiard-balls. The bread—but that couldn’t be
17233 helped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the bread
17234 contained the only fresh fare they had. But the forecastle was not very
17235 light, and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you
17236 ate it. But all in all, taking her from truck to helm, considering the
17237 dimensions of the cook’s boilers, including his own live parchment
17238 boilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship; of
17239 good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack fellows all, and
17240 capital from boot heels to hat-band.
17241 
17242 But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other
17243 English whalers I know of—not all though—were such famous, hospitable
17244 ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the
17245 joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? I
17246 will tell you. The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is
17247 matter for historical research. Nor have I been at all sparing of
17248 historical whale research, when it has seemed needed.
17249 
17250 The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,
17251 Zealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant
17252 in the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions, touching
17253 plenty to eat and drink. For, as a general thing, the English
17254 merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence,
17255 in the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and
17256 natural, but incidental and particular; and, therefore, must have some
17257 special origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further
17258 elucidated.
17259 
17260 During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an
17261 ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew
17262 must be about whalers. The title was, “Dan Coopman,” wherefore I
17263 concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam
17264 cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was
17265 reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one
17266 “Fitz Swackhammer.” But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man,
17267 professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus
17268 and St. Pott’s, to whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a
17269 box of sperm candles for his trouble—this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as
17270 he spied the book, assured me that “Dan Coopman” did not mean “The
17271 Cooper,” but “The Merchant.” In short, this ancient and learned Low
17272 Dutch book treated of the commerce of Holland; and, among other
17273 subjects, contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery.
17274 And in this chapter it was, headed, “Smeer,” or “Fat,” that I found a
17275 long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180
17276 sail of Dutch whalemen; from which list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead,
17277 I transcribe the following:
17278 
17279 400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesland pork. 150,000 lbs. of stock
17280 fish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,800 firkins
17281 of butter. 20,000 lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese
17282 (probably an inferior article). 550 ankers of Geneva. 10,800 barrels of
17283 beer.
17284 
17285 Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in
17286 the present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole
17287 pipes, barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.
17288 
17289 At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this
17290 beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were
17291 incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and Platonic
17292 application; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary tables of my
17293 own, touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc., consumed by
17294 every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen
17295 whale fishery. In the first place, the amount of butter, and Texel and
17296 Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their
17297 naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the
17298 nature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game
17299 in those frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux
17300 country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of
17301 train oil.
17302 
17303 The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those
17304 polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that
17305 climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen,
17306 including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not
17307 much exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their
17308 fleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I
17309 say, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks’
17310 allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin.
17311 Now, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might
17312 fancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up in a
17313 boat’s head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem
17314 somewhat improbable. Yet they did aim at them, and hit them too. But
17315 this was very far North, be it remembered, where beer agrees well with
17316 the constitution; upon the Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would
17317 be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his
17318 boat; and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.
17319 
17320 But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of
17321 two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English
17322 whalers have not neglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when
17323 cruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of the
17324 world, get a good dinner out of it, at least. And this empties the
17325 decanter.
17326 
17327 
17328 CHAPTER 102. A Bower in the Arsacides.
17329 
17330 Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly
17331 dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail
17332 upon some few interior structural features. But to a large and thorough
17333 sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still
17334 further, and untagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters,
17335 and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost
17336 bones, set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to say, in his
17337 unconditional skeleton.
17338 
17339 But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the
17340 fishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the
17341 whale? Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures
17342 on the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a
17343 specimen rib for exhibition? Explain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land a
17344 full-grown whale on your deck for examination, as a cook dishes a
17345 roast-pig? Surely not. A veritable witness have you hitherto been,
17346 Ishmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah alone;
17347 the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams; the rafters,
17348 ridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings, making up the frame-work of
17349 leviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats, dairy-rooms, butteries, and
17350 cheeseries in his bowels.
17351 
17352 I confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far
17353 beneath the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been blessed
17354 with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature. In a ship I belonged
17355 to, a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his
17356 poke or bag, to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons, and for the
17357 heads of the lances. Think you I let that chance go, without using my
17358 boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking the seal and reading all the
17359 contents of that young cub?
17360 
17361 And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their
17362 gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am indebted
17363 to my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of the Arsacides.
17364 For being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey
17365 of Algiers, I was invited to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with
17366 the lord of Tranque, at his retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side
17367 glen not very far distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town, his
17368 capital.
17369 
17370 Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being gifted
17371 with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought
17372 together in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his
17373 people could invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices,
17374 chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes; and
17375 all these distributed among whatever natural wonders, the
17376 wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores.
17377 
17378 Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an
17379 unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his
17380 head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings
17381 seemed his verdant jet. When the vast body had at last been stripped of
17382 its fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become dust dry in the sun,
17383 then the skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen, where
17384 a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it.
17385 
17386 The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebræ were carved with
17387 Arsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests
17388 kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head again
17389 sent forth its vapory spout; while, suspended from a bough, the
17390 terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like the hair-hung
17391 sword that so affrighted Damocles.
17392 
17393 It was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen;
17394 the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the
17395 industrious earth beneath was as a weaver’s loom, with a gorgeous
17396 carpet on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and
17397 woof, and the living flowers the figures. All the trees, with all their
17398 laden branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the
17399 message-carrying air; all these unceasingly were active. Through the
17400 lacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving
17401 the unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!—pause!—one
17402 word!—whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all
17403 these ceaseless toilings? Speak, weaver!—stay thy hand!—but one single
17404 word with thee! Nay—the shuttle flies—the figures float from forth the
17405 loom; the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god,
17406 he weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal
17407 voice; and by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened;
17408 and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak
17409 through it. For even so it is in all material factories. The spoken
17410 words that are inaudible among the flying spindles; those same words
17411 are plainly heard without the walls, bursting from the opened
17412 casements. Thereby have villainies been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be
17413 heedful; for so, in all this din of the great world’s loom, thy
17414 subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar.
17415 
17416 Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the
17417 great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging—a gigantic idler! Yet,
17418 as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around
17419 him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven over
17420 with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure; but
17421 himself a skeleton. Life folded Death; Death trellised Life; the grim
17422 god wived with youthful Life, and begat him curly-headed glories.
17423 
17424 Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw the
17425 skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real
17426 jet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an
17427 object of vertu. He laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests
17428 should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine. To and fro I paced
17429 before this skeleton—brushed the vines aside—broke through the ribs—and
17430 with a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long amid its many
17431 winding, shaded colonnades and arbours. But soon my line was out; and
17432 following it back, I emerged from the opening where I entered. I saw no
17433 living thing within; naught was there but bones.
17434 
17435 Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the
17436 skeleton. From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me
17437 taking the altitude of the final rib, “How now!” they shouted; “Dar’st
17438 thou measure this our god! That’s for us.” “Aye, priests—well, how long
17439 do ye make him, then?” But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them,
17440 concerning feet and inches; they cracked each other’s sconces with
17441 their yard-sticks—the great skull echoed—and seizing that lucky chance,
17442 I quickly concluded my own admeasurements.
17443 
17444 These admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first, be it
17445 recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied
17446 measurement I please. Because there are skeleton authorities you can
17447 refer to, to test my accuracy. There is a Leviathanic Museum, they tell
17448 me, in Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that country, where
17449 they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales. Likewise,
17450 I have heard that in the museum of Manchester, in New Hampshire, they
17451 have what the proprietors call “the only perfect specimen of a
17452 Greenland or River Whale in the United States.” Moreover, at a place in
17453 Yorkshire, England, Burton Constable by name, a certain Sir Clifford
17454 Constable has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but of
17455 moderate size, by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend
17456 King Tranquo’s.
17457 
17458 In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons
17459 belonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar
17460 grounds. King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir
17461 Clifford, because he was lord of the seignories of those parts. Sir
17462 Clifford’s whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a great
17463 chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony
17464 cavities—spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan—and swing all day upon
17465 his lower jaw. Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and
17466 shutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of
17467 keys at his side. Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep
17468 at the whispering gallery in the spinal column; threepence to hear the
17469 echo in the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for the unrivalled
17470 view from his forehead.
17471 
17472 The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied
17473 verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild
17474 wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving
17475 such valuable statistics. But as I was crowded for space, and wished
17476 the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then
17477 composing—at least, what untattooed parts might remain—I did not
17478 trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all
17479 enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.
17480 
17481 
17482 CHAPTER 103. Measurement of The Whale’s Skeleton.
17483 
17484 In the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain
17485 statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton
17486 we are briefly to exhibit. Such a statement may prove useful here.
17487 
17488 According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base
17489 upon Captain Scoresby’s estimate, of seventy tons for the largest sized
17490 Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful
17491 calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between
17492 eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty
17493 feet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least
17494 ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would
17495 considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one
17496 thousand one hundred inhabitants.
17497 
17498 Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to
17499 this leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman’s imagination?
17500 
17501 Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,
17502 jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now
17503 simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his
17504 unobstructed bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a
17505 proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the
17506 most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it
17507 in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under
17508 your arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion
17509 of the general structure we are about to view.
17510 
17511 In length, the Sperm Whale’s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two
17512 feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have
17513 been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one
17514 fifth in length compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two
17515 feet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty
17516 feet of plain back-bone. Attached to this back-bone, for something less
17517 than a third of its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs
17518 which once enclosed his vitals.
17519 
17520 To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,
17521 extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled
17522 the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some
17523 twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,
17524 for the time, but a long, disconnected timber.
17525 
17526 The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck, was
17527 nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each
17528 successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one
17529 of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From
17530 that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only
17531 spanned five feet and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore
17532 a seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most
17533 arched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay
17534 footpath bridges over small streams.
17535 
17536 In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the
17537 circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of
17538 the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of
17539 the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the
17540 fish which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of
17541 the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least
17542 sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more
17543 than eight feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion
17544 of the living magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I
17545 now saw but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with
17546 tons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for
17547 the ample fins, I here saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of
17548 the weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!
17549 
17550 How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try
17551 to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his
17552 dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in
17553 the heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his
17554 angry flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully
17555 invested whale be truly and livingly found out.
17556 
17557 But the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a
17558 crane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now
17559 it’s done, it looks much like Pompey’s Pillar.
17560 
17561 There are forty and odd vertebræ in all, which in the skeleton are not
17562 locked together. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a
17563 Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest, a
17564 middle one, is in width something less than three feet, and in depth
17565 more than four. The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the
17566 tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something like a white
17567 billiard-ball. I was told that there were still smaller ones, but they
17568 had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the priest’s children,
17569 who had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how that the
17570 spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into
17571 simple child’s play.
17572 
17573 
17574 CHAPTER 104. The Fossil Whale.
17575 
17576 From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon
17577 to enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not
17578 compress him. By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial
17579 folio. Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail, and
17580 the yards he measures about the waist; only think of the gigantic
17581 involutions of his intestines, where they lie in him like great cables
17582 and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a
17583 line-of-battle-ship.
17584 
17585 Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me to
17586 approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not
17587 overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him
17588 out to the uttermost coil of his bowels. Having already described him
17589 in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it now
17590 remains to magnify him in an archæological, fossiliferous, and
17591 antediluvian point of view. Applied to any other creature than the
17592 Leviathan—to an ant or a flea—such portly terms might justly be deemed
17593 unwarrantably grandiloquent. But when Leviathan is the text, the case
17594 is altered. Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest
17595 words of the dictionary. And here be it said, that whenever it has been
17596 convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations, I have
17597 invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson, expressly purchased
17598 for that purpose; because that famous lexicographer’s uncommon personal
17599 bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author
17600 like me.
17601 
17602 One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject,
17603 though it may seem but an ordinary one. How, then, with me, writing of
17604 this Leviathan? Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard
17605 capitals. Give me a condor’s quill! Give me Vesuvius’ crater for an
17606 inkstand! Friends, hold my arms! For in the mere act of penning my
17607 thoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with their
17608 outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole
17609 circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and
17610 mastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas
17611 of empire on earth, and throughout the whole universe, not excluding
17612 its suburbs. Such, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and
17613 liberal theme! We expand to its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you
17614 must choose a mighty theme. No great and enduring volume can ever be
17615 written on the flea, though many there be who have tried it.
17616 
17617 Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my
17618 credentials as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I
17619 have been a stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches, canals and
17620 wells, wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by
17621 way of preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that while in the
17622 earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now
17623 almost completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in what are
17624 called the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate
17625 intercepted links, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose
17626 remote posterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the Fossil
17627 Whales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period, which is the
17628 last preceding the superficial formations. And though none of them
17629 precisely answer to any known species of the present time, they are yet
17630 sufficiently akin to them in general respects, to justify their taking
17631 rank as Cetacean fossils.
17632 
17633 Detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones
17634 and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals,
17635 been found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England,
17636 in Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.
17637 Among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the
17638 year 1779 was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris, a short street
17639 opening almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and bones
17640 disinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon’s
17641 time. Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some
17642 utterly unknown Leviathanic species.
17643 
17644 But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost
17645 complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842,
17646 on the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama. The awe-stricken
17647 credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the
17648 fallen angels. The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and
17649 bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus. But some specimen bones of
17650 it being taken across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it turned
17651 out that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed
17652 species. A significant illustration of the fact, again and again
17653 repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but
17654 little clue to the shape of his fully invested body. So Owen
17655 rechristened the monster Zeuglodon; and in his paper read before the
17656 London Geological Society, pronounced it, in substance, one of the most
17657 extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted
17658 out of existence.
17659 
17660 When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks,
17661 jaws, ribs, and vertebræ, all characterized by partial resemblances to
17662 the existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing on
17663 the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical
17664 Leviathans, their incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, borne back to
17665 that wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have begun; for
17666 time began with man. Here Saturn’s grey chaos rolls over me, and I
17667 obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when
17668 wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics; and
17669 in all the 25,000 miles of this world’s circumference, not an
17670 inhabitable hand’s breadth of land was visible. Then the whole world
17671 was the whale’s; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the
17672 present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs. Who can show a pedigree
17673 like Leviathan? Ahab’s harpoon had shed older blood than the Pharaoh’s.
17674 Methuselah seems a school-boy. I look round to shake hands with Shem. I
17675 am horror-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced existence of the
17676 unspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been before all time,
17677 must needs exist after all humane ages are over.
17678 
17679 But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the
17680 stereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his
17681 ancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim
17682 for them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the unmistakable
17683 print of his fin. In an apartment of the great temple of Denderah, some
17684 fifty years ago, there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a
17685 sculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins,
17686 and dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe
17687 of the moderns. Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam as of yore; was
17688 there swimming in that planisphere, centuries before Solomon was
17689 cradled.
17690 
17691 Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity
17692 of the whale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as set down by
17693 the venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.
17694 
17695 “Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams
17696 of which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are
17697 oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore. The Common People imagine,
17698 that by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the Temple, no Whale can
17699 pass it without immediate death. But the truth of the Matter is, that
17700 on either side of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into
17701 the Sea, and wound the Whales when they light upon ’em. They keep a
17702 Whale’s Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle, which lying upon the
17703 Ground with its convex part uppermost, makes an Arch, the Head of which
17704 cannot be reached by a Man upon a Camel’s Back. This Rib (says John
17705 Leo) is said to have layn there a hundred Years before I saw it. Their
17706 Historians affirm, that a Prophet who prophesy’d of Mahomet, came from
17707 this Temple, and some do not stand to assert, that the Prophet Jonas
17708 was cast forth by the Whale at the Base of the Temple.”
17709 
17710 In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be a
17711 Nantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.
17712 
17713 
17714 CHAPTER 105. Does the Whale’s Magnitude Diminish?—Will He Perish?
17715 
17716 Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from
17717 the head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether,
17718 in the long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from the
17719 original bulk of his sires.
17720 
17721 But upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the
17722 present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are
17723 found in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period
17724 prior to man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those
17725 belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier
17726 ones.
17727 
17728 Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the
17729 Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than
17730 seventy feet in length in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen,
17731 that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a
17732 large sized modern whale. And I have heard, on whalemen’s authority,
17733 that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the
17734 time of capture.
17735 
17736 But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an
17737 advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may
17738 it not be, that since Adam’s time they have degenerated?
17739 
17740 Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of
17741 such gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For
17742 Pliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and
17743 Aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length—Rope
17744 Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales! And even in the days of Banks and
17745 Solander, Cooke’s naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy
17746 of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or
17747 Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards; that is, three
17748 hundred and sixty feet. And Lacépède, the French naturalist, in his
17749 elaborate history of whales, in the very beginning of his work (page
17750 3), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and
17751 twenty-eight feet. And this work was published so late as A.D. 1825.
17752 
17753 But will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is
17754 as big as his ancestors in Pliny’s time. And if ever I go where Pliny
17755 is, I, a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him so.
17756 Because I cannot understand how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies
17757 that were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not
17758 measure so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks;
17759 and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest
17760 Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in which they
17761 are drawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize
17762 cattle of Smithfield, not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude the
17763 fattest of Pharaoh’s fat kine; in the face of all this, I will not
17764 admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated.
17765 
17766 But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more
17767 recondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient
17768 look-outs at the mast-heads of the whale-ships, now penetrating even
17769 through Behring’s straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and
17770 lockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along
17771 all continental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan can long
17772 endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether he must not
17773 at last be exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the
17774 last man, smoke his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final
17775 puff.
17776 
17777 Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo,
17778 which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the
17779 prairies of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and
17780 scowled with their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous
17781 river-capitals, where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar
17782 an inch; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem
17783 furnished, to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy
17784 extinction.
17785 
17786 But you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a
17787 period ago—not a good lifetime—the census of the buffalo in Illinois
17788 exceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the present day
17789 not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region; and though the
17790 cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man; yet the far
17791 different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious
17792 an end to the Leviathan. Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales
17793 for forty-eight months think they have done extremely well, and thank
17794 God, if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish. Whereas, in the
17795 days of the old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West,
17796 when the far west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness
17797 and a virgin, the same number of moccasined men, for the same number of
17798 months, mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain
17799 not forty, but forty thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need
17800 were, could be statistically stated.
17801 
17802 Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the
17803 gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former
17804 years (the latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in
17805 small pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in
17806 consequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more
17807 remunerative. Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales,
17808 influenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in immense
17809 caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes,
17810 and pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but
17811 widely separated, unfrequent armies. That is all. And equally
17812 fallacious seems the conceit, that because the so-called whale-bone
17813 whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with
17814 them, hence that species also is declining. For they are only being
17815 driven from promontory to cape; and if one coast is no longer enlivened
17816 with their jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand has been
17817 very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.
17818 
17819 Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two
17820 firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain
17821 impregnable. And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty
17822 Swiss have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the savannas
17823 and glades of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at last resort
17824 to their Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers
17825 and walls there, come up among icy fields and floes; and in a charmed
17826 circle of everlasting December, bid defiance to all pursuit from man.
17827 
17828 But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one
17829 cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this
17830 positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions.
17831 But though for some time past a number of these whales, not less than
17832 13,000, have been annually slain on the nor’ west coast by the
17833 Americans alone; yet there are considerations which render even this
17834 circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this
17835 matter.
17836 
17837 Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness
17838 of the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to
17839 Harto, the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the
17840 King of Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are
17841 numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes. And there seems
17842 no reason to doubt that if these elephants, which have now been hunted
17843 for thousands of years, by Semiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all
17844 the successive monarchs of the East—if they still survive there in
17845 great numbers, much more may the great whale outlast all hunting, since
17846 he has a pasture to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as
17847 all Asia, both Americas, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the
17848 Isles of the sea combined.
17849 
17850 Moreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity of
17851 whales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more,
17852 therefore at any one period of time, several distinct adult generations
17853 must be contemporary. And what that is, we may soon gain some idea of,
17854 by imagining all the grave-yards, cemeteries, and family vaults of
17855 creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men, women, and
17856 children who were alive seventy-five years ago; and adding this
17857 countless host to the present human population of the globe.
17858 
17859 Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his
17860 species, however perishable in his individuality. He swam the seas
17861 before the continents broke water; he once swam over the site of the
17862 Tuileries, and Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin. In Noah’s flood he
17863 despised Noah’s Ark; and if ever the world is to be again flooded, like
17864 the Netherlands, to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale will
17865 still survive, and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial
17866 flood, spout his frothed defiance to the skies.
17867 
17868 
17869 CHAPTER 106. Ahab’s Leg.
17870 
17871 The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel
17872 Enderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence to
17873 his own person. He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his
17874 boat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock. And when
17875 after gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so
17876 vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman (it
17877 was, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly enough);
17878 then, the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and
17879 wrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all appearances
17880 lusty, yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.
17881 
17882 And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his
17883 pervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to the
17884 condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood. For it had not
17885 been very long prior to the Pequod’s sailing from Nantucket, that he
17886 had been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and insensible;
17887 by some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his
17888 ivory limb having been so violently displaced, that it had stake-wise
17889 smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme
17890 difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured.
17891 
17892 Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all
17893 the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of
17894 a former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most
17895 poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as
17896 the sweetest songster of the grove; so, equally with every felicity,
17897 all miserable events do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than
17898 equally, thought Ahab; since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief
17899 go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of
17900 this: that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings, that
17901 while some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them
17902 for the other world, but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the
17903 joy-childlessness of all hell’s despair; whereas, some guilty mortal
17904 miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally
17905 progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave; not at all to hint of
17906 this, there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the
17907 thing. For, thought Ahab, while even the highest earthly felicities
17908 ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them, but, at
17909 bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic significance, and, in some men, an
17910 archangelic grandeur; so do their diligent tracings-out not belie the
17911 obvious deduction. To trail the genealogies of these high mortal
17912 miseries, carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the
17913 gods; so that, in the face of all the glad, hay-making suns, and soft
17914 cymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that
17915 the gods themselves are not for ever glad. The ineffaceable, sad
17916 birth-mark in the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the
17917 signers.
17918 
17919 Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more
17920 properly, in set way, have been disclosed before. With many other
17921 particulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained a mystery to some,
17922 why it was, that for a certain period, both before and after the
17923 sailing of the Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such
17924 Grand-Lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought
17925 speechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate of the dead.
17926 Captain Peleg’s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means
17927 adequate; though, indeed, as touching all Ahab’s deeper part, every
17928 revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory
17929 light. But, in the end, it all came out; this one matter did, at least.
17930 That direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness. And
17931 not only this, but to that ever-contracting, dropping circle ashore,
17932 who, for any reason, possessed the privilege of a less banned approach
17933 to him; to that timid circle the above hinted casualty—remaining, as it
17934 did, moodily unaccounted for by Ahab—invested itself with terrors, not
17935 entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails. So that,
17936 through their zeal for him, they had all conspired, so far as in them
17937 lay, to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others; and hence it
17938 was, that not till a considerable interval had elapsed, did it
17939 transpire upon the Pequod’s decks.
17940 
17941 But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the air,
17942 or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or not
17943 with earthly Ahab, yet, in this present matter of his leg, he took
17944 plain practical procedures;—he called the carpenter.
17945 
17946 And when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without
17947 delay set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him
17948 supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) which
17949 had thus far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a careful
17950 selection of the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be secured.
17951 This done, the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that
17952 night; and to provide all the fittings for it, independent of those
17953 pertaining to the distrusted one in use. Moreover, the ship’s forge was
17954 ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold; and,
17955 to accelerate the affair, the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at
17956 once to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed.
17957 
17958 
17959 CHAPTER 107. The Carpenter.
17960 
17961 Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high
17962 abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But
17963 from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they
17964 seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary.
17965 But most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of
17966 the high, humane abstraction; the Pequod’s carpenter was no duplicate;
17967 hence, he now comes in person on this stage.
17968 
17969 Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging
17970 to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent,
17971 alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his
17972 own; the carpenter’s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk
17973 of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with
17974 wood as an auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of
17975 the generic remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly
17976 efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually
17977 recurring in a large ship, upon a three or four years’ voyage, in
17978 uncivilized and far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in
17979 ordinary duties:—repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the
17980 shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull’s eyes in the deck, or new
17981 tree-nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more
17982 directly pertaining to his special business; he was moreover
17983 unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both
17984 useful and capricious.
17985 
17986 The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,
17987 was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several
17988 vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times
17989 except when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed
17990 athwartships against the rear of the Try-works.
17991 
17992 A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole:
17993 the carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and
17994 straightway files it smaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage
17995 strays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of
17996 right-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter
17997 makes a pagoda-looking cage for it. An oarsman sprains his wrist: the
17998 carpenter concocts a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars
17999 to be painted upon the blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his
18000 big vice of wood, the carpenter symmetrically supplies the
18001 constellation. A sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the
18002 carpenter drills his ears. Another has the toothache: the carpenter out
18003 pincers, and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there;
18004 but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded
18005 operation; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter
18006 signs him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have him draw the tooth.
18007 
18008 Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent
18009 and without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he
18010 deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But
18011 while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with
18012 such liveliness of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue
18013 some uncommon vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For
18014 nothing was this man more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal
18015 stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the
18016 surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed one with the general
18017 stolidity discernible in the whole visible world; which while
18018 pauselessly active in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace,
18019 and ignores you, though you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was
18020 this half-horrible stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an
18021 all-ramifying heartlessness;—yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an
18022 old, crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked
18023 now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have
18024 served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded
18025 forecastle of Noah’s ark. Was it that this old carpenter had been a
18026 life-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had
18027 gathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small
18028 outward clingings might have originally pertained to him? He was a
18029 stript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born
18030 babe; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next.
18031 You might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him
18032 involved a sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did
18033 not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he
18034 had been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or
18035 uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal
18036 process. He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one,
18037 must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers. He was
18038 like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful, _multum in
18039 parvo_, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior—though a little
18040 swelled—of a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of
18041 various sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls,
18042 pens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted
18043 to use the carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open
18044 that part of him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him
18045 up by the legs, and there they were.
18046 
18047 Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter,
18048 was, after all, no mere machine of an automaton. If he did not have a
18049 common soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously
18050 did its duty. What that was, whether essence of quicksilver, or a few
18051 drops of hartshorn, there is no telling. But there it was; and there it
18052 had abided for now some sixty years or more. And this it was, this same
18053 unaccountable, cunning life-principle in him; this it was, that kept
18054 him a great part of the time soliloquizing; but only like an
18055 unreasoning wheel, which also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his
18056 body was a sentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard there, and talking
18057 all the time to keep himself awake.
18058 
18059 
18060 CHAPTER 108. Ahab and the Carpenter.
18061 
18062 The Deck—First Night Watch.
18063 
18064 (_Carpenter standing before his vice-bench, and by the light of two
18065 lanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg, which joist is
18066 firmly fixed in the vice. Slabs of ivory, leather straps, pads, screws,
18067 and various tools of all sorts lying about the bench. Forward, the red
18068 flame of the forge is seen, where the blacksmith is at work._)
18069 
18070 Drat the file, and drat the bone! That is hard which should be soft,
18071 and that is soft which should be hard. So we go, who file old jaws and
18072 shinbones. Let’s try another. Aye, now, this works better (_sneezes_).
18073 Halloa, this bone dust is (_sneezes_)—why it’s (_sneezes_)—yes it’s
18074 (_sneezes_)—bless my soul, it won’t let me speak! This is what an old
18075 fellow gets now for working in dead lumber. Saw a live tree, and you
18076 don’t get this dust; amputate a live bone, and you don’t get it
18077 (_sneezes_). Come, come, you old Smut, there, bear a hand, and let’s
18078 have that ferule and buckle-screw; I’ll be ready for them presently.
18079 Lucky now (_sneezes_) there’s no knee-joint to make; that might puzzle
18080 a little; but a mere shinbone—why it’s easy as making hop-poles; only I
18081 should like to put a good finish on. Time, time; if I but only had the
18082 time, I could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever (_sneezes_)
18083 scraped to a lady in a parlor. Those buckskin legs and calves of legs
18084 I’ve seen in shop windows wouldn’t compare at all. They soak water,
18085 they do; and of course get rheumatic, and have to be doctored
18086 (_sneezes_) with washes and lotions, just like live legs. There; before
18087 I saw it off, now, I must call his old Mogulship, and see whether the
18088 length will be all right; too short, if anything, I guess. Ha! that’s
18089 the heel; we are in luck; here he comes, or it’s somebody else, that’s
18090 certain.
18091 
18092 AHAB (_advancing_). (_During the ensuing scene, the carpenter continues
18093 sneezing at times._)
18094 
18095 Well, manmaker!
18096 
18097 Just in time, sir. If the captain pleases, I will now mark the length.
18098 Let me measure, sir.
18099 
18100 Measured for a leg! good. Well, it’s not the first time. About it!
18101 There; keep thy finger on it. This is a cogent vice thou hast here,
18102 carpenter; let me feel its grip once. So, so; it does pinch some.
18103 
18104 Oh, sir, it will break bones—beware, beware!
18105 
18106 No fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this slippery
18107 world that can hold, man. What’s Prometheus about there?—the
18108 blacksmith, I mean—what’s he about?
18109 
18110 He must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.
18111 
18112 Right. It’s a partnership; he supplies the muscle part. He makes a
18113 fierce red flame there!
18114 
18115 Aye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.
18116 
18117 Um-m. So he must. I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that old
18118 Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a
18119 blacksmith, and animated them with fire; for what’s made in fire must
18120 properly belong to fire; and so hell’s probable. How the soot flies!
18121 This must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans of. Carpenter,
18122 when he’s through with that buckle, tell him to forge a pair of steel
18123 shoulder-blades; there’s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack.
18124 
18125 Sir?
18126 
18127 Hold; while Prometheus is about it, I’ll order a complete man after a
18128 desirable pattern. Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then, chest
18129 modelled after the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to ’em, to stay
18130 in one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no heart at all,
18131 brass forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains; and let
18132 me see—shall I order eyes to see outwards? No, but put a sky-light on
18133 top of his head to illuminate inwards. There, take the order, and away.
18134 
18135 Now, what’s he speaking about, and who’s he speaking to, I should like
18136 to know? Shall I keep standing here? (_aside_).
18137 
18138 ’Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here’s one. No,
18139 no, no; I must have a lantern.
18140 
18141 Ho, ho! That’s it, hey? Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.
18142 
18143 What art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man?
18144 Thrusted light is worse than presented pistols.
18145 
18146 I thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.
18147 
18148 Carpenter? why that’s—but no;—a very tidy, and, I may say, an extremely
18149 gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here, carpenter;—or would’st
18150 thou rather work in clay?
18151 
18152 Sir?—Clay? clay, sir? That’s mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.
18153 
18154 The fellow’s impious! What art thou sneezing about?
18155 
18156 Bone is rather dusty, sir.
18157 
18158 Take the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself under
18159 living people’s noses.
18160 
18161 Sir?—oh! ah!—I guess so;—yes—oh, dear!
18162 
18163 Look ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a right good
18164 workmanlike workman, eh? Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well for
18165 thy work, if, when I come to mount this leg thou makest, I shall
18166 nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it; that
18167 is, carpenter, my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean. Canst
18168 thou not drive that old Adam away?
18169 
18170 Truly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now. Yes, I have heard
18171 something curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never
18172 entirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still
18173 pricking him at times. May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?
18174 
18175 It is, man. Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once
18176 was; so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to the
18177 soul. Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there, there to
18178 a hair, do I. Is’t a riddle?
18179 
18180 I should humbly call it a poser, sir.
18181 
18182 Hist, then. How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking thing
18183 may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where
18184 thou now standest; aye, and standing there in thy spite? In thy most
18185 solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, don’t
18186 speak! And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be
18187 now so long dissolved; then, why mayst not thou, carpenter, feel the
18188 fiery pains of hell for ever, and without a body? Hah!
18189 
18190 Good Lord! Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over
18191 again; I think I didn’t carry a small figure, sir.
18192 
18193 Look ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.—How long before the
18194 leg is done?
18195 
18196 Perhaps an hour, sir.
18197 
18198 Bungle away at it then, and bring it to me (_turns to go_). Oh, Life!
18199 Here I am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this
18200 blockhead for a bone to stand on! Cursed be that mortal
18201 inter-indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers. I would be free
18202 as air; and I’m down in the whole world’s books. I am so rich, I could
18203 have given bid for bid with the wealthiest Prætorians at the auction of
18204 the Roman empire (which was the world’s); and yet I owe for the flesh
18205 in the tongue I brag with. By heavens! I’ll get a crucible, and into
18206 it, and dissolve myself down to one small, compendious vertebra. So.
18207 
18208 CARPENTER (_resuming his work_).
18209 
18210 Well, well, well! Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says
18211 he’s queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer;
18212 he’s queer, says Stubb; he’s queer—queer, queer; and keeps dinning it
18213 into Mr. Starbuck all the time—queer—sir—queer, queer, very queer. And
18214 here’s his leg! Yes, now that I think of it, here’s his bedfellow! has
18215 a stick of whale’s jaw-bone for a wife! And this is his leg; he’ll
18216 stand on this. What was that now about one leg standing in three
18217 places, and all three places standing in one hell—how was that? Oh! I
18218 don’t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I’m a sort of
18219 strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that’s only haphazard-like.
18220 Then, a short, little old body like me, should never undertake to wade
18221 out into deep waters with tall, heron-built captains; the water chucks
18222 you under the chin pretty quick, and there’s a great cry for
18223 life-boats. And here’s the heron’s leg! long and slim, sure enough!
18224 Now, for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime, and that must be
18225 because they use them mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady uses her
18226 roly-poly old coach-horses. But Ahab; oh he’s a hard driver. Look,
18227 driven one leg to death, and spavined the other for life, and now wears
18228 out bone legs by the cord. Halloa, there, you Smut! bear a hand there
18229 with those screws, and let’s finish it before the resurrection fellow
18230 comes a-calling with his horn for all legs, true or false, as
18231 brewery-men go round collecting old beer barrels, to fill ’em up again.
18232 What a leg this is! It looks like a real live leg, filed down to
18233 nothing but the core; he’ll be standing on this to-morrow; he’ll be
18234 taking altitudes on it. Halloa! I almost forgot the little oval slate,
18235 smoothed ivory, where he figures up the latitude. So, so; chisel, file,
18236 and sand-paper, now!
18237 
18238 
18239 CHAPTER 109. Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin.
18240 
18241 According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo! no
18242 inconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below must have
18243 sprung a bad leak. Much concern was shown; and Starbuck went down into
18244 the cabin to report this unfavourable affair.*
18245 
18246 *In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it
18247 is a regular semi-weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and
18248 drench the casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying
18249 intervals, is removed by the ship’s pumps. Hereby the casks are sought
18250 to be kept damply tight; while by the changed character of the
18251 withdrawn water, the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the
18252 precious cargo.
18253 
18254 Now, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and
18255 the Bashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets from
18256 the China waters into the Pacific. And so Starbuck found Ahab with a
18257 general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him; and
18258 another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the
18259 Japanese islands—Niphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke. With his snow-white new
18260 ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table, and with a long
18261 pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous old man, with
18262 his back to the gangway door, was wrinkling his brow, and tracing his
18263 old courses again.
18264 
18265 “Who’s there?” hearing the footstep at the door, but not turning round
18266 to it. “On deck! Begone!”
18267 
18268 “Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I. The oil in the hold is leaking, sir.
18269 We must up Burtons and break out.”
18270 
18271 “Up Burtons and break out? Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to here
18272 for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?”
18273 
18274 “Either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make
18275 good in a year. What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth
18276 saving, sir.”
18277 
18278 “So it is, so it is; if we get it.”
18279 
18280 “I was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir.”
18281 
18282 “And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all. Begone! Let it
18283 leak! I’m all aleak myself. Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of leaky
18284 casks, but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that’s a far
18285 worse plight than the Pequod’s, man. Yet I don’t stop to plug my leak;
18286 for who can find it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to plug it,
18287 even if found, in this life’s howling gale? Starbuck! I’ll not have the
18288 Burtons hoisted.”
18289 
18290 “What will the owners say, sir?”
18291 
18292 “Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons. What
18293 cares Ahab? Owners, owners? Thou art always prating to me, Starbuck,
18294 about those miserly owners, as if the owners were my conscience. But
18295 look ye, the only real owner of anything is its commander; and hark ye,
18296 my conscience is in this ship’s keel.—On deck!”
18297 
18298 “Captain Ahab,” said the reddening mate, moving further into the cabin,
18299 with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost
18300 seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward
18301 manifestation of itself, but within also seemed more than half
18302 distrustful of itself; “A better man than I might well pass over in
18303 thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man; aye, and in
18304 a happier, Captain Ahab.”
18305 
18306 “Devils! Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me?—On
18307 deck!”
18308 
18309 “Nay, sir, not yet; I do entreat. And I do dare, sir—to be forbearing!
18310 Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto, Captain Ahab?”
18311 
18312 Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most
18313 South-Sea-men’s cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck,
18314 exclaimed: “There is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one
18315 Captain that is lord over the Pequod.—On deck!”
18316 
18317 For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery cheeks,
18318 you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of
18319 the levelled tube. But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and
18320 as he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said: “Thou hast
18321 outraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware
18322 of Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab;
18323 beware of thyself, old man.”
18324 
18325 “He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!”
18326 murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared. “What’s that he said—Ahab
18327 beware of Ahab—there’s something there!” Then unconsciously using the
18328 musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little
18329 cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed, and
18330 returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck.
18331 
18332 “Thou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck,” he said lowly to the mate;
18333 then raising his voice to the crew: “Furl the t’gallant-sails, and
18334 close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up Burton,
18335 and break out in the main-hold.”
18336 
18337 It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting
18338 Starbuck, Ahab thus acted. It may have been a flash of honesty in him;
18339 or mere prudential policy which, under the circumstance, imperiously
18340 forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection, however transient,
18341 in the important chief officer of his ship. However it was, his orders
18342 were executed; and the Burtons were hoisted.
18343 
18344 
18345 CHAPTER 110. Queequeg in His Coffin.
18346 
18347 Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold
18348 were perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off. So, it
18349 being calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the
18350 slumbers of the huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight
18351 sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above. So deep did they
18352 go; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the lowermost
18353 puncheons, that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone
18354 cask containing coins of Captain Noah, with copies of the posted
18355 placards, vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood.
18356 Tierce after tierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and shooks of
18357 staves, and iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted out, till at last the
18358 piled decks were hard to get about; and the hollow hull echoed under
18359 foot, as if you were treading over empty catacombs, and reeled and
18360 rolled in the sea like an air-freighted demijohn. Top-heavy was the
18361 ship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in his head. Well was
18362 it that the Typhoons did not visit them then.
18363 
18364 Now, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast
18365 bosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him nigh
18366 to his endless end.
18367 
18368 Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;
18369 dignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the
18370 higher you rise the harder you toil. So with poor Queequeg, who, as
18371 harpooneer, must not only face all the rage of the living whale, but—as
18372 we have elsewhere seen—mount his dead back in a rolling sea; and
18373 finally descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating all
18374 day in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the
18375 clumsiest casks and see to their stowage. To be short, among whalemen,
18376 the harpooneers are the holders, so called.
18377 
18378 Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should
18379 have stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where,
18380 stripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about
18381 amid that dampness and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom
18382 of a well. And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor
18383 pagan; where, strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he
18384 caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever; and at last, after
18385 some days’ suffering, laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill
18386 of the door of death. How he wasted and wasted away in those few
18387 long-lingering days, till there seemed but little left of him but his
18388 frame and tattooing. But as all else in him thinned, and his
18389 cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless, seemed growing fuller
18390 and fuller; they became of a strange softness of lustre; and mildly but
18391 deeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony
18392 to that immortal health in him which could not die, or be weakened. And
18393 like circles on the water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his
18394 eyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity. An awe
18395 that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of
18396 this waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any
18397 beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is truly
18398 wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. And
18399 the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all
18400 with a last revelation, which only an author from the dead could
18401 adequately tell. So that—let us say it again—no dying Chaldee or Greek
18402 had higher and holier thoughts than those, whose mysterious shades you
18403 saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay in his
18404 swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his
18405 final rest, and the ocean’s invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and
18406 higher towards his destined heaven.
18407 
18408 Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself,
18409 what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he
18410 asked. He called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was
18411 just breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he had
18412 chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the rich
18413 war-wood of his native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned that all
18414 whalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark canoes,
18415 and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for it was
18416 not unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a dead
18417 warrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated
18418 away to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they believe that the
18419 stars are isles, but that far beyond all visible horizons, their own
18420 mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens; and so form
18421 the white breakers of the milky way. He added, that he shuddered at the
18422 thought of being buried in his hammock, according to the usual
18423 sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks.
18424 No: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket, all the more congenial
18425 to him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat these coffin-canoes
18426 were without a keel; though that involved but uncertain steering, and
18427 much lee-way adown the dim ages.
18428 
18429 Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter
18430 was at once commanded to do Queequeg’s bidding, whatever it might
18431 include. There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber aboard,
18432 which, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal
18433 groves of the Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks the coffin
18434 was recommended to be made. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the
18435 order, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent
18436 promptitude of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and took
18437 Queequeg’s measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg’s
18438 person as he shifted the rule.
18439 
18440 “Ah! poor fellow! he’ll have to die now,” ejaculated the Long Island
18441 sailor.
18442 
18443 Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general
18444 reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the
18445 coffin was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two
18446 notches at its extremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his
18447 tools, and to work.
18448 
18449 When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he
18450 lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring
18451 whether they were ready for it yet in that direction.
18452 
18453 Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people
18454 on deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every one’s
18455 consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to
18456 him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some
18457 dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will
18458 shortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be
18459 indulged.
18460 
18461 Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an
18462 attentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock
18463 drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along
18464 with one of the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also,
18465 biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh
18466 water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up
18467 in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for
18468 a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that
18469 he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without
18470 moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out his
18471 little god, Yojo. Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo
18472 between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he called it) to be placed
18473 over him. The head part turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay
18474 Queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in
18475 view. “Rarmai” (it will do; it is easy), he murmured at last, and
18476 signed to be replaced in his hammock.
18477 
18478 But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all
18479 this while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, took
18480 him by the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.
18481 
18482 “Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? where
18483 go ye now? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where
18484 the beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little
18485 errand for me? Seek out one Pip, who’s now been missing long: I think
18486 he’s in those far Antilles. If ye find him, then comfort him; for he
18487 must be very sad; for look! he’s left his tambourine behind;—I found
18488 it. Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die; and I’ll beat ye your
18489 dying march.”
18490 
18491 “I have heard,” murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, “that in
18492 violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues; and
18493 that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their
18494 wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken
18495 in their hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor
18496 Pip, in this strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers
18497 of all our heavenly homes. Where learned he that, but there?—Hark! he
18498 speaks again: but more wildly now.”
18499 
18500 “Form two and two! Let’s make a General of him! Ho, where’s his
18501 harpoon? Lay it across here.—Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! Oh for a game
18502 cock now to sit upon his head and crow! Queequeg dies game!—mind ye
18503 that; Queequeg dies game!—take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies
18504 game! I say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he died a coward;
18505 died all a’shiver;—out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip, tell all the
18506 Antilles he’s a runaway; a coward, a coward, a coward! Tell them he
18507 jumped from a whale-boat! I’d never beat my tambourine over base Pip,
18508 and hail him General, if he were once more dying here. No, no! shame
18509 upon all cowards—shame upon them! Let ’em go drown like Pip, that
18510 jumped from a whale-boat. Shame! shame!”
18511 
18512 During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip
18513 was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.
18514 
18515 But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now
18516 that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon
18517 there seemed no need of the carpenter’s box: and thereupon, when some
18518 expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the
18519 cause of his sudden convalescence was this;—at a critical moment, he
18520 had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone;
18521 and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet,
18522 he averred. They asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter
18523 of his own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a
18524 word, it was Queequeg’s conceit, that if a man made up his mind to
18525 live, mere sickness could not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale,
18526 or some violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.
18527 
18528 Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized;
18529 that while a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing,
18530 generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day.
18531 So, in good time my Queequeg gained strength; and at length after
18532 sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but eating with a
18533 vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms
18534 and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned a little bit, and then
18535 springing into the head of his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon,
18536 pronounced himself fit for a fight.
18537 
18538 With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and
18539 emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there.
18540 Many spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of
18541 grotesque figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was
18542 striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on
18543 his body. And this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet
18544 and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written
18545 out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a
18546 mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg in
18547 his own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work in one
18548 volume; but whose mysteries not even himself could read, though his own
18549 live heart beat against them; and these mysteries were therefore
18550 destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon
18551 they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the last. And this thought
18552 it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his,
18553 when one morning turning away from surveying poor Queequeg—“Oh,
18554 devilish tantalization of the gods!”
18555 
18556 
18557 CHAPTER 111. The Pacific.
18558 
18559 When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great
18560 South Sea; were it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear
18561 Pacific with uncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my
18562 youth was answered; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a
18563 thousand leagues of blue.
18564 
18565 There is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose gently
18566 awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath; like those
18567 fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St.
18568 John. And meet it is, that over these sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery
18569 prairies and Potters’ Fields of all four continents, the waves should
18570 rise and fall, and ebb and flow unceasingly; for here, millions of
18571 mixed shades and shadows, drowned dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all
18572 that we call lives and souls, lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing
18573 like slumberers in their beds; the ever-rolling waves but made so by
18574 their restlessness.
18575 
18576 To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld, must
18577 ever after be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the midmost waters of
18578 the world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms. The same
18579 waves wash the moles of the new-built Californian towns, but yesterday
18580 planted by the recentest race of men, and lave the faded but still
18581 gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than Abraham; while all between
18582 float milky-ways of coral isles, and low-lying, endless, unknown
18583 Archipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans. Thus this mysterious, divine
18584 Pacific zones the world’s whole bulk about; makes all coasts one bay to
18585 it; seems the tide-beating heart of earth. Lifted by those eternal
18586 swells, you needs must own the seductive god, bowing your head to Pan.
18587 
18588 But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab’s brain, as standing like an iron
18589 statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with one
18590 nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles
18591 (in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking), and with the other
18592 consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea; that sea in
18593 which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming. Launched at
18594 length upon these almost final waters, and gliding towards the Japanese
18595 cruising-ground, the old man’s purpose intensified itself. His firm
18596 lips met like the lips of a vice; the Delta of his forehead’s veins
18597 swelled like overladen brooks; in his very sleep, his ringing cry ran
18598 through the vaulted hull, “Stern all! the White Whale spouts thick
18599 blood!”
18600 
18601 
18602 CHAPTER 112. The Blacksmith.
18603 
18604 Availing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in
18605 these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits
18606 shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old
18607 blacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the hold again, after
18608 concluding his contributory work for Ahab’s leg, but still retained it
18609 on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being now almost
18610 incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and bowsmen to do
18611 some little job for them; altering, or repairing, or new shaping their
18612 various weapons and boat furniture. Often he would be surrounded by an
18613 eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding boat-spades,
18614 pike-heads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching his every
18615 sooty movement, as he toiled. Nevertheless, this old man’s was a
18616 patient hammer wielded by a patient arm. No murmur, no impatience, no
18617 petulance did come from him. Silent, slow, and solemn; bowing over
18618 still further his chronically broken back, he toiled away, as if toil
18619 were life itself, and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating
18620 of his heart. And so it was.—Most miserable!
18621 
18622 A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful appearing
18623 yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage excited the
18624 curiosity of the mariners. And to the importunity of their persisted
18625 questionings he had finally given in; and so it came to pass that every
18626 one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate.
18627 
18628 Belated, and not innocently, one bitter winter’s midnight, on the road
18629 running between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly felt
18630 the deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning,
18631 dilapidated barn. The issue was, the loss of the extremities of both
18632 feet. Out of this revelation, part by part, at last came out the four
18633 acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as yet uncatastrophied
18634 fifth act of the grief of his life’s drama.
18635 
18636 He was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly
18637 encountered that thing in sorrow’s technicals called ruin. He had been
18638 an artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house
18639 and garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three
18640 blithe, ruddy children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church,
18641 planted in a grove. But one night, under cover of darkness, and further
18642 concealed in a most cunning disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into
18643 his happy home, and robbed them all of everything. And darker yet to
18644 tell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into
18645 his family’s heart. It was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of
18646 that fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now,
18647 for prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith’s shop was
18648 in the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so
18649 that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no
18650 unhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing
18651 of her young-armed old husband’s hammer; whose reverberations, muffled
18652 by passing through the floors and walls, came up to her, not unsweetly,
18653 in her nursery; and so, to stout Labor’s iron lullaby, the blacksmith’s
18654 infants were rocked to slumber.
18655 
18656 Oh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely?
18657 Hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came
18658 upon him, then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and her
18659 orphans a truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their after
18660 years; and all of them a care-killing competency. But Death plucked
18661 down some virtuous elder brother, on whose whistling daily toil solely
18662 hung the responsibilities of some other family, and left the worse than
18663 useless old man standing, till the hideous rot of life should make him
18664 easier to harvest.
18665 
18666 Why tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every day grew
18667 more and more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the
18668 last; the wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes,
18669 glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children; the bellows
18670 fell; the forge choked up with cinders; the house was sold; the mother
18671 dived down into the long church-yard grass; her children twice followed
18672 her thither; and the houseless, familyless old man staggered off a
18673 vagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his grey head a scorn to
18674 flaxen curls!
18675 
18676 Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but Death
18677 is only a launching into the region of the strange Untried; it is but
18678 the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote, the
18679 Wild, the Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the death-longing eyes of
18680 such men, who still have left in them some interior compunctions
18681 against suicide, does the all-contributed and all-receptive ocean
18682 alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable, taking
18683 terrors, and wonderful, new-life adventures; and from the hearts of
18684 infinite Pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to them—“Come hither,
18685 broken-hearted; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate
18686 death; here are wonders supernatural, without dying for them. Come
18687 hither! bury thyself in a life which, to your now equally abhorred and
18688 abhorring, landed world, is more oblivious than death. Come hither! put
18689 up _thy_ gravestone, too, within the churchyard, and come hither, till
18690 we marry thee!”
18691 
18692 Hearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and by
18693 fall of eve, the blacksmith’s soul responded, Aye, I come! And so Perth
18694 went a-whaling.
18695 
18696 
18697 CHAPTER 113. The Forge.
18698 
18699 With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about
18700 mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter
18701 placed upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in the
18702 coals, and with the other at his forge’s lungs, when Captain Ahab came
18703 along, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag. While
18704 yet a little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till at last,
18705 Perth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering it upon the
18706 anvil—the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights,
18707 some of which flew close to Ahab.
18708 
18709 “Are these thy Mother Carey’s chickens, Perth? they are always flying
18710 in thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;—look here, they
18711 burn; but thou—thou liv’st among them without a scorch.”
18712 
18713 “Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab,” answered Perth, resting
18714 for a moment on his hammer; “I am past scorching; not easily can’st
18715 thou scorch a scar.”
18716 
18717 “Well, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely woeful
18718 to me. In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in others
18719 that is not mad. Thou should’st go mad, blacksmith; say, why dost thou
18720 not go mad? How can’st thou endure without being mad? Do the heavens
18721 yet hate thee, that thou can’st not go mad?—What wert thou making
18722 there?”
18723 
18724 “Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it.”
18725 
18726 “And can’st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such hard
18727 usage as it had?”
18728 
18729 “I think so, sir.”
18730 
18731 “And I suppose thou can’st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never
18732 mind how hard the metal, blacksmith?”
18733 
18734 “Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one.”
18735 
18736 “Look ye here, then,” cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning
18737 with both hands on Perth’s shoulders; “look ye here—_here_—can ye
18738 smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith,” sweeping one hand across his
18739 ribbed brow; “if thou could’st, blacksmith, glad enough would I lay my
18740 head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes.
18741 Answer! Can’st thou smoothe this seam?”
18742 
18743 “Oh! that is the one, sir! Said I not all seams and dents but one?”
18744 
18745 “Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for
18746 though thou only see’st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into
18747 the bone of my skull—_that_ is all wrinkles! But, away with child’s
18748 play; no more gaffs and pikes to-day. Look ye here!” jingling the
18749 leathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins. “I, too, want a harpoon
18750 made; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part, Perth;
18751 something that will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone. There’s the
18752 stuff,” flinging the pouch upon the anvil. “Look ye, blacksmith, these
18753 are the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses.”
18754 
18755 “Horse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the
18756 best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work.”
18757 
18758 “I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the
18759 melted bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me
18760 first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer
18761 these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick!
18762 I’ll blow the fire.”
18763 
18764 When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by
18765 spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. “A
18766 flaw!” rejecting the last one. “Work that over again, Perth.”
18767 
18768 This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when
18769 Ahab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. As, then,
18770 with regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to
18771 him the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed forge
18772 shooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and
18773 bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or
18774 some blessing on the toil. But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside.
18775 
18776 “What’s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?” muttered
18777 Stubb, looking on from the forecastle. “That Parsee smells fire like a
18778 fusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot musket’s powder-pan.”
18779 
18780 At last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as
18781 Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near
18782 by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab’s bent face.
18783 
18784 “Would’st thou brand me, Perth?” wincing for a moment with the pain;
18785 “have I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?”
18786 
18787 “Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab. Is not this
18788 harpoon for the White Whale?”
18789 
18790 “For the white fiend! But now for the barbs; thou must make them
18791 thyself, man. Here are my razors—the best of steel; here, and make the
18792 barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea.”
18793 
18794 For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would
18795 fain not use them.
18796 
18797 “Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave, sup,
18798 nor pray till—but here—to work!”
18799 
18800 Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the
18801 shank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the
18802 blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to
18803 tempering them, he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.
18804 
18805 “No, no—no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper. Ahoy,
18806 there! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me
18807 as much blood as will cover this barb?” holding it high up. A cluster
18808 of dark nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen
18809 flesh, and the White Whale’s barbs were then tempered.
18810 
18811 “Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!”
18812 deliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the
18813 baptismal blood.
18814 
18815 Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of
18816 hickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the
18817 socket of the iron. A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some
18818 fathoms of it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension.
18819 Pressing his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-string,
18820 then eagerly bending over it, and seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed,
18821 “Good! and now for the seizings.”
18822 
18823 At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns
18824 were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole
18825 was then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the rope
18826 was traced half-way along the pole’s length, and firmly secured so,
18827 with intertwistings of twine. This done, pole, iron, and rope—like the
18828 Three Fates—remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily stalked away with
18829 the weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound of the hickory
18830 pole, both hollowly ringing along every plank. But ere he entered his
18831 cabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was
18832 heard. Oh, Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy
18833 strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the
18834 melancholy ship, and mocked it!
18835 
18836 
18837 CHAPTER 114. The Gilder.
18838 
18839 Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising
18840 ground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery. Often, in mild,
18841 pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty hours on
18842 the stretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily pulling, or
18843 sailing, or paddling after the whales, or for an interlude of sixty or
18844 seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising; though with but small
18845 success for their pains.
18846 
18847 At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow
18848 heaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so
18849 sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like hearth-stone
18850 cats they purr against the gunwale; these are the times of dreamy
18851 quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the
18852 ocean’s skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it; and
18853 would not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but conceals a
18854 remorseless fang.
18855 
18856 These are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a
18857 certain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he
18858 regards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing
18859 only the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through high
18860 rolling waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie: as when
18861 the western emigrants’ horses only show their erected ears, while their
18862 hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.
18863 
18864 The long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these
18865 there steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied
18866 children lie sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when
18867 the flowers of the woods are plucked. And all this mixes with your most
18868 mystic mood; so that fact and fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate,
18869 and form one seamless whole.
18870 
18871 Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as
18872 temporary an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did seem
18873 to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath
18874 upon them prove but tarnishing.
18875 
18876 Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in
18877 ye,—though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life,—in ye,
18878 men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning clover; and for some
18879 few fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them.
18880 Would to God these blessed calms would last. But the mingled, mingling
18881 threads of life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a
18882 storm for every calm. There is no steady unretracing progress in this
18883 life; we do not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one
18884 pause:—through infancy’s unconscious spell, boyhood’s thoughtless
18885 faith, adolescence’ doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then
18886 disbelief, resting at last in manhood’s pondering repose of If. But
18887 once gone through, we trace the round again; and are infants, boys, and
18888 men, and Ifs eternally. Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor
18889 no more? In what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest will
18890 never weary? Where is the foundling’s father hidden? Our souls are like
18891 those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of
18892 our paternity lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it.
18893 
18894 And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat’s side into that
18895 same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:—
18896 
18897 “Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride’s
18898 eye!—Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping
18899 cannibal ways. Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep
18900 down and do believe.”
18901 
18902 And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same
18903 golden light:—
18904 
18905 “I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths that
18906 he has always been jolly!”
18907 
18908 
18909 CHAPTER 115. The Pequod Meets The Bachelor.
18910 
18911 And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down
18912 before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab’s harpoon had been welded.
18913 
18914 It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her
18915 last cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in
18916 glad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously,
18917 sailing round among the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous
18918 to pointing her prow for home.
18919 
18920 The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red
18921 bunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended,
18922 bottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long
18923 lower jaw of the last whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks
18924 of all colours were flying from her rigging, on every side. Sideways
18925 lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm;
18926 above which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of
18927 the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen
18928 lamp.
18929 
18930 As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most
18931 surprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in
18932 the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without
18933 securing a single fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been
18934 given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional
18935 supplemental casks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met;
18936 and these were stowed along the deck, and in the captain’s and
18937 officers’ state-rooms. Even the cabin table itself had been knocked
18938 into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an
18939 oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. In the
18940 forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests,
18941 and filled them; it was humorously added, that the cook had clapped a
18942 head on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the steward had plugged
18943 his spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the harpooneers had headed the
18944 sockets of their irons and filled them; that indeed everything was
18945 filled with sperm, except the captain’s pantaloons pockets, and those
18946 he reserved to thrust his hands into, in self-complacent testimony of
18947 his entire satisfaction.
18948 
18949 As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the
18950 barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing
18951 still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge
18952 try-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like _poke_ or stomach skin
18953 of the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the
18954 clenched hands of the crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates and
18955 harpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with
18956 them from the Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat,
18957 firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three Long
18958 Island negroes, with glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were
18959 presiding over the hilarious jig. Meanwhile, others of the ship’s
18960 company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try-works, from
18961 which the huge pots had been removed. You would have almost thought
18962 they were pulling down the cursed Bastille, such wild cries they
18963 raised, as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the
18964 sea.
18965 
18966 Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the
18967 ship’s elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was
18968 full before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual
18969 diversion.
18970 
18971 And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black,
18972 with a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other’s
18973 wakes—one all jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings
18974 as to things to come—their two captains in themselves impersonated the
18975 whole striking contrast of the scene.
18976 
18977 “Come aboard, come aboard!” cried the gay Bachelor’s commander, lifting
18978 a glass and a bottle in the air.
18979 
18980 “Hast seen the White Whale?” gritted Ahab in reply.
18981 
18982 “No; only heard of him; but don’t believe in him at all,” said the
18983 other good-humoredly. “Come aboard!”
18984 
18985 “Thou art too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?”
18986 
18987 “Not enough to speak of—two islanders, that’s all;—but come aboard, old
18988 hearty, come along. I’ll soon take that black from your brow. Come
18989 along, will ye (merry’s the play); a full ship and homeward-bound.”
18990 
18991 “How wondrous familiar is a fool!” muttered Ahab; then aloud, “Thou art
18992 a full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me an
18993 empty ship, and outward-bound. So go thy ways, and I will mine. Forward
18994 there! Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!”
18995 
18996 And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other
18997 stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crew
18998 of the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the
18999 receding Bachelor; but the Bachelor’s men never heeding their gaze for
19000 the lively revelry they were in. And as Ahab, leaning over the
19001 taffrail, eyed the homeward-bound craft, he took from his pocket a
19002 small vial of sand, and then looking from the ship to the vial, seemed
19003 thereby bringing two remote associations together, for that vial was
19004 filled with Nantucket soundings.
19005 
19006 
19007 CHAPTER 116. The Dying Whale.
19008 
19009 Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune’s favourites
19010 sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the
19011 rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So seemed
19012 it with the Pequod. For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor,
19013 whales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by Ahab.
19014 
19015 It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the
19016 crimson fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky,
19017 sun and whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness and
19018 such plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy
19019 air, that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent
19020 valleys of the Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned
19021 sailor, had gone to sea, freighted with these vesper hymns.
19022 
19023 Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned
19024 off from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings from the
19025 now tranquil boat. For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm
19026 whales dying—the turning sunwards of the head, and so expiring—that
19027 strange spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab
19028 conveyed a wondrousness unknown before.
19029 
19030 “He turns and turns him to it,—how slowly, but how steadfastly, his
19031 homage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions. He too
19032 worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun!—Oh
19033 that these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring sights.
19034 Look! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe; in
19035 these most candid and impartial seas; where to traditions no rocks
19036 furnish tablets; where for long Chinese ages, the billows have still
19037 rolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine upon the
19038 Niger’s unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full of faith;
19039 but see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the corpse, and it
19040 heads some other way.
19041 
19042 “Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast builded
19043 thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas;
19044 thou art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly speakest to me in the
19045 wide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed burial of its after calm. Nor
19046 has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head, and then gone round
19047 again, without a lesson to me.
19048 
19049 “Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power! Oh, high aspiring,
19050 rainbowed jet!—that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain! In
19051 vain, oh whale, dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening
19052 sun, that only calls forth life, but gives it not again. Yet dost thou,
19053 darker half, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith. All thy
19054 unnamable imminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed by breaths of
19055 once living things, exhaled as air, but water now.
19056 
19057 “Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild
19058 fowl finds his only rest. Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea; though
19059 hill and valley mothered me, ye billows are my foster-brothers!”
19060 
19061 
19062 CHAPTER 117. The Whale Watch.
19063 
19064 The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to
19065 windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. These
19066 last three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward one
19067 could not be reached till morning; and the boat that had killed it lay
19068 by its side all night; and that boat was Ahab’s.
19069 
19070 The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale’s spout-hole; and
19071 the lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare upon
19072 the black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which
19073 gently chafed the whale’s broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.
19074 
19075 Ahab and all his boat’s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who
19076 crouching in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played
19077 round the whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails. A
19078 sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven
19079 ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.
19080 
19081 Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and
19082 hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a
19083 flooded world. “I have dreamed it again,” said he.
19084 
19085 “Of the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor
19086 coffin can be thine?”
19087 
19088 “And who are hearsed that die on the sea?”
19089 
19090 “But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two
19091 hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by
19092 mortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in
19093 America.”
19094 
19095 “Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:—a hearse and its plumes
19096 floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers. Ha! Such a
19097 sight we shall not soon see.”
19098 
19099 “Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.”
19100 
19101 “And what was that saying about thyself?”
19102 
19103 “Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot.”
19104 
19105 “And when thou art so gone before—if that ever befall—then ere I can
19106 follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?—Was it not so?
19107 Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here two
19108 pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it.”
19109 
19110 “Take another pledge, old man,” said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted up
19111 like fire-flies in the gloom—“Hemp only can kill thee.”
19112 
19113 “The gallows, ye mean.—I am immortal then, on land and on sea,” cried
19114 Ahab, with a laugh of derision;—“Immortal on land and on sea!”
19115 
19116 Both were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and the
19117 slumbering crew arose from the boat’s bottom, and ere noon the dead
19118 whale was brought to the ship.
19119 
19120 
19121 CHAPTER 118. The Quadrant.
19122 
19123 The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,
19124 coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would
19125 ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to
19126 the braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed
19127 on the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to point the ship’s
19128 prow for the equator. In good time the order came. It was hard upon
19129 high noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat, was
19130 about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his
19131 latitude.
19132 
19133 Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of
19134 effulgences. That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing
19135 focus of the glassy ocean’s immeasurable burning-glass. The sky looks
19136 lacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this
19137 nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of
19138 God’s throne. Well that Ahab’s quadrant was furnished with coloured
19139 glasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging
19140 his seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his
19141 astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in that
19142 posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun
19143 should gain its precise meridian. Meantime while his whole attention
19144 was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship’s deck,
19145 and with face thrown up like Ahab’s, was eyeing the same sun with him;
19146 only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face was
19147 subdued to an earthly passionlessness. At length the desired
19148 observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab
19149 soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant. Then
19150 falling into a moment’s revery, he again looked up towards the sun and
19151 murmured to himself: “Thou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou
19152 tellest me truly where I _am_—but canst thou cast the least hint where
19153 I _shall_ be? Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is
19154 this moment living? Where is Moby Dick? This instant thou must be
19155 eyeing him. These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now
19156 beholding him; aye, and into the eye that is even now equally beholding
19157 the objects on the unknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!”
19158 
19159 Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its
19160 numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:
19161 “Foolish toy! babies’ plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores,
19162 and Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but
19163 what after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where
19164 thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that
19165 holds thee: no! not one jot more! Thou canst not tell where one drop of
19166 water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy
19167 impotence thou insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy;
19168 and cursed be all the things that cast man’s eyes aloft to that heaven,
19169 whose live vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes are even now
19170 scorched with thy light, O sun! Level by nature to this earth’s horizon
19171 are the glances of man’s eyes; not shot from the crown of his head, as
19172 if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament. Curse thee, thou
19173 quadrant!” dashing it to the deck, “no longer will I guide my earthly
19174 way by thee; the level ship’s compass, and the level dead-reckoning, by
19175 log and by line; _these_ shall conduct me, and show me my place on the
19176 sea. Aye,” lighting from the boat to the deck, “thus I trample on thee,
19177 thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high; thus I split and
19178 destroy thee!”
19179 
19180 As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and
19181 dead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a
19182 fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself—these passed over the
19183 mute, motionless Parsee’s face. Unobserved he rose and glided away;
19184 while, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered
19185 together on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck,
19186 shouted out—“To the braces! Up helm!—square in!”
19187 
19188 In an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled upon
19189 her heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her
19190 long, ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one
19191 sufficient steed.
19192 
19193 Standing between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod’s
19194 tumultuous way, and Ahab’s also, as he went lurching along the deck.
19195 
19196 “I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full
19197 of its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down,
19198 down, to dumbest dust. Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of
19199 thine, what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!”
19200 
19201 “Aye,” cried Stubb, “but sea-coal ashes—mind ye that, Mr.
19202 Starbuck—sea-coal, not your common charcoal. Well, well; I heard Ahab
19203 mutter, ‘Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of
19204 mine; swears that I must play them, and no others.’ And damn me, Ahab,
19205 but thou actest right; live in the game, and die in it!”
19206 
19207 
19208 CHAPTER 119. The Candles.
19209 
19210 Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal
19211 crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure. Skies the most
19212 effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows
19213 tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands. So, too, it is, that in
19214 these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of
19215 all storms, the Typhoon. It will sometimes burst from out that
19216 cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.
19217 
19218 Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and
19219 bare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly
19220 ahead. When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the
19221 thunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed the disabled masts
19222 fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the
19223 tempest had left for its after sport.
19224 
19225 Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at
19226 every flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional
19227 disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb
19228 and Flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer
19229 lashing of the boats. But all their pains seemed naught. Though lifted
19230 to the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahab’s) did
19231 not escape. A great rolling sea, dashing high up against the reeling
19232 ship’s high teetering side, stove in the boat’s bottom at the stern,
19233 and left it again, all dripping through like a sieve.
19234 
19235 “Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck,” said Stubb, regarding the wreck,
19236 “but the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can’t fight it. You
19237 see, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps,
19238 all round the world it runs, and then comes the spring! But as for me,
19239 all the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck here. But
19240 never mind; it’s all in fun: so the old song says;”—(_sings_.)
19241 
19242 
19243   Oh! jolly is the gale, And a joker is the whale, A’ flourishin’ his
19244   tail,— Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the
19245   Ocean, oh!
19246 
19247   The scud all a flyin’, That’s his flip only foamin’; When he stirs in
19248   the spicin’,— Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad,
19249   is the Ocean, oh!
19250 
19251   Thunder splits the ships, But he only smacks his lips, A tastin’ of
19252   this flip,— Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad,
19253   is the Ocean, oh!
19254 
19255 
19256 
19257 “Avast Stubb,” cried Starbuck, “let the Typhoon sing, and strike his
19258 harp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold
19259 thy peace.”
19260 
19261 “But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a coward;
19262 and I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell you what it is, Mr.
19263 Starbuck, there’s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my
19264 throat. And when that’s done, ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a
19265 wind-up.”
19266 
19267 “Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.”
19268 
19269 “What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never
19270 mind how foolish?”
19271 
19272 “Here!” cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing his
19273 hand towards the weather bow, “markest thou not that the gale comes
19274 from the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the
19275 very course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where
19276 is that stove? In the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand—his
19277 stand-point is stove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing away, if thou
19278 must!
19279 
19280 “I don’t half understand ye: what’s in the wind?”
19281 
19282 “Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to
19283 Nantucket,” soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb’s
19284 question. “The gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it
19285 into a fair wind that will drive us towards home. Yonder, to windward,
19286 all is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward—I see it lightens up
19287 there; but not with the lightning.”
19288 
19289 At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following
19290 the flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same
19291 instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.
19292 
19293 “Who’s there?”
19294 
19295 “Old Thunder!” said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his
19296 pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed
19297 lances of fire.
19298 
19299 Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off
19300 the perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some
19301 ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But
19302 as this conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may
19303 avoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly
19304 towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering
19305 not a little with some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the
19306 vessel’s way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a
19307 ship’s lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally made
19308 in long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the
19309 chains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require.
19310 
19311 “The rods! the rods!” cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished
19312 to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting
19313 flambeaux, to light Ahab to his post. “Are they overboard? drop them
19314 over, fore and aft. Quick!”
19315 
19316 “Avast!” cried Ahab; “let’s have fair play here, though we be the
19317 weaker side. Yet I’ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and
19318 Andes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let
19319 them be, sir.”
19320 
19321 “Look aloft!” cried Starbuck. “The corpusants! the corpusants!”
19322 
19323 All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each
19324 tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each of
19325 the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like
19326 three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.
19327 
19328 “Blast the boat! let it go!” cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashing
19329 sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violently
19330 jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. “Blast it!”—but slipping
19331 backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames; and
19332 immediately shifting his tone he cried—“The corpusants have mercy on us
19333 all!”
19334 
19335 To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of
19336 the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses
19337 from the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a seething
19338 sea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when
19339 God’s burning finger has been laid on the ship; when His “Mene, Mene,
19340 Tekel Upharsin” has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.
19341 
19342 While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the
19343 enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle, all
19344 their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away
19345 constellation of stars. Relieved against the ghostly light, the
19346 gigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and
19347 seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come. The parted
19348 mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely
19349 gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by
19350 the preternatural light, Queequeg’s tattooing burned like Satanic blue
19351 flames on his body.
19352 
19353 The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more
19354 the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment
19355 or two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one.
19356 It was Stubb. “What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not
19357 the same in the song.”
19358 
19359 “No, no, it wasn’t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I
19360 hope they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?—have
19361 they no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck—but it’s too dark
19362 to look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign
19363 of good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be
19364 chock a’ block with sperm-oil, d’ye see; and so, all that sperm will
19365 work up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three masts will
19366 yet be as three spermaceti candles—that’s the good promise we saw.”
19367 
19368 At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb’s face slowly beginning
19369 to glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: “See! see!” and once
19370 more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled
19371 supernaturalness in their pallor.
19372 
19373 “The corpusants have mercy on us all,” cried Stubb, again.
19374 
19375 At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame,
19376 the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab’s front, but with his head bowed away
19377 from him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where
19378 they had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen,
19379 arrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a
19380 knot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various
19381 enchanted attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or running
19382 skeletons in Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck; but all
19383 their eyes upcast.
19384 
19385 “Aye, aye, men!” cried Ahab. “Look up at it; mark it well; the white
19386 flame but lights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those mainmast
19387 links there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against
19388 it; blood against fire! So.”
19389 
19390 Then turning—the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot
19391 upon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm,
19392 he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.
19393 
19394 “Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian
19395 once did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that
19396 to this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I
19397 now know that thy right worship is defiance. To neither love nor
19398 reverence wilt thou be kind; and e’en for hate thou canst but kill; and
19399 all are killed. No fearless fool now fronts thee. I own thy speechless,
19400 placeless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will
19401 dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me. In the midst of
19402 the personified impersonal, a personality stands here. Though but a
19403 point at best; whencesoe’er I came; wheresoe’er I go; yet while I
19404 earthly live, the queenly personality lives in me, and feels her royal
19405 rights. But war is pain, and hate is woe. Come in thy lowest form of
19406 love, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy highest, come as mere
19407 supernal power; and though thou launchest navies of full-freighted
19408 worlds, there’s that in here that still remains indifferent. Oh, thou
19409 clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like a true child of
19410 fire, I breathe it back to thee.”
19411 
19412 [_Sudden, repeated flashes of lightning; the nine flames leap
19413 lengthwise to thrice their previous height; Ahab, with the rest, closes
19414 his eyes, his right hand pressed hard upon them._]
19415 
19416 “I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so? Nor was it wrung
19417 from me; nor do I now drop these links. Thou canst blind; but I can
19418 then grope. Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes. Take the
19419 homage of these poor eyes, and shutter-hands. I would not take it. The
19420 lightning flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and ache; my
19421 whole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some stunning
19422 ground. Oh, oh! Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee. Light though
19423 thou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am darkness leaping out of
19424 light, leaping out of thee! The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not?
19425 There burn the flames! Oh, thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my
19426 genealogy. But thou art but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know
19427 not. Oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her? There lies my puzzle; but
19428 thine is greater. Thou knowest not how came ye, hence callest thyself
19429 unbegotten; certainly knowest not thy beginning, hence callest thyself
19430 unbegun. I know that of me, which thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou
19431 omnipotent. There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear
19432 spirit, to whom all thy eternity is but time, all thy creativeness
19433 mechanical. Through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly
19434 see it. Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast
19435 thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief. Here again with
19436 haughty agony, I read my sire. Leap! leap up, and lick the sky! I leap
19437 with thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded with thee; defyingly
19438 I worship thee!”
19439 
19440 “The boat! the boat!” cried Starbuck, “look at thy boat, old man!”
19441 
19442 Ahab’s harpoon, the one forged at Perth’s fire, remained firmly lashed
19443 in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his whale-boat’s
19444 bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather
19445 sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there now came a
19446 levelled flame of pale, forked fire. As the silent harpoon burned there
19447 like a serpent’s tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm—“God, God is
19448 against thee, old man; forbear! ’tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill
19449 continued; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a
19450 fair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.”
19451 
19452 Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the
19453 braces—though not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast
19454 mate’s thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But
19455 dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching the
19456 burning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them; swearing to
19457 transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope’s end.
19458 Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery dart
19459 that he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke:—
19460 
19461 “All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and
19462 heart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye
19463 may know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out
19464 the last fear!” And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the
19465 flame.
19466 
19467 As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood of
19468 some lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render it
19469 so much the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for
19470 thunderbolts; so at those last words of Ahab’s many of the mariners did
19471 run from him in a terror of dismay.

19477 
19478 “We must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir. The band is working
19479 loose and the lee lift is half-stranded. Shall I strike it, sir?”
19480 
19481 “Strike nothing; lash it. If I had sky-sail poles, I’d sway them up
19482 now.”
19483 
19484 “Sir!—in God’s name!—sir?”
19485 
19486 “Well.”
19487 
19488 “The anchors are working, sir. Shall I get them inboard?”
19489 
19490 “Strike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything. The wind rises,
19491 but it has not got up to my table-lands yet. Quick, and see to it.—By
19492 masts and keels! he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper of some
19493 coasting smack. Send down my main-top-sail yard! Ho, gluepots! Loftiest
19494 trucks were made for wildest winds, and this brain-truck of mine now
19495 sails amid the cloud-scud. Shall I strike that? Oh, none but cowards
19496 send down their brain-trucks in tempest time. What a hooroosh aloft
19497 there! I would e’en take it for sublime, did I not know that the colic
19498 is a noisy malady. Oh, take medicine, take medicine!”

19502 
19503 _Stubb and Flask mounted on them, and passing additional lashings over
19504 the anchors there hanging._
19505 
19506 “No, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you please, but
19507 you will never pound into me what you were just now saying. And how
19508 long ago is it since you said the very contrary? Didn’t you once say
19509 that whatever ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something extra
19510 on its insurance policy, just as though it were loaded with powder
19511 barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward? Stop, now; didn’t you say
19512 so?”
19513 
19514 “Well, suppose I did? What then? I’ve part changed my flesh since that
19515 time, why not my mind? Besides, supposing we _are_ loaded with powder
19516 barrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the lucifers get
19517 afire in this drenching spray here? Why, my little man, you have pretty
19518 red hair, but you couldn’t get afire now. Shake yourself; you’re
19519 Aquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your coat
19520 collar. Don’t you see, then, that for these extra risks the Marine
19521 Insurance companies have extra guarantees? Here are hydrants, Flask.
19522 But hark, again, and I’ll answer ye the other thing. First take your
19523 leg off from the crown of the anchor here, though, so I can pass the
19524 rope; now listen. What’s the mighty difference between holding a mast’s
19525 lightning-rod in the storm, and standing close by a mast that hasn’t
19526 got any lightning-rod at all in a storm? Don’t you see, you
19527 timber-head, that no harm can come to the holder of the rod, unless the
19528 mast is first struck? What are you talking about, then? Not one ship in
19529 a hundred carries rods, and Ahab,—aye, man, and all of us,—were in no
19530 more danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in ten
19531 thousand ships now sailing the seas. Why, you King-Post, you, I suppose
19532 you would have every man in the world go about with a small
19533 lightning-rod running up the corner of his hat, like a militia
19534 officer’s skewered feather, and trailing behind like his sash. Why
19535 don’t ye be sensible, Flask? it’s easy to be sensible; why don’t ye,
19536 then? any man with half an eye can be sensible.”
19537 
19538 “I don’t know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard.”
19539 
19540 “Yes, when a fellow’s soaked through, it’s hard to be sensible, that’s
19541 a fact. And I am about drenched with this spray. Never mind; catch the
19542 turn there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors
19543 now as if they were never going to be used again. Tying these two
19544 anchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man’s hands behind him. And
19545 what big generous hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron
19546 fists, hey? What a hold they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether the
19547 world is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an uncommon long
19548 cable, though. There, hammer that knot down, and we’ve done. So; next
19549 to touching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory. I say,
19550 just wring out my jacket skirts, will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at
19551 long-togs so, Flask; but seems to me, a long tailed coat ought always
19552 to be worn in all storms afloat. The tails tapering down that way,
19553 serve to carry off the water, d’ye see. Same with cocked hats; the
19554 cocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask. No more monkey-jackets and
19555 tarpaulins for me; I must mount a swallow-tail, and drive down a
19556 beaver; so. Halloa! whew! there goes my tarpaulin overboard; Lord,
19557 Lord, that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly!
19558 This is a nasty night, lad.”

19565 “Um, um, um. Stop that thunder! Plenty too much thunder up here. What’s
19566 the use of thunder? Um, um, um. We don’t want thunder; we want rum;
19567 give us a glass of rum. Um, um, um!”
19568 
19569 
19570 CHAPTER 123. The Musket.
19571 
19572 During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the Pequod’s
19573 jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by
19574 its spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had been attached
19575 to it—for they were slack—because some play to the tiller was
19576 indispensable.
19577 
19578 In a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock
19579 to the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the
19580 compasses, at intervals, go round and round. It was thus with the
19581 Pequod’s; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice
19582 the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards; it is a
19583 sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted
19584 emotion.
19585 
19586 Some hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the
19587 strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb—one engaged forward and the
19588 other aft—the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sails
19589 were cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away to leeward, like
19590 the feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are cast to the winds
19591 when that storm-tossed bird is on the wing.
19592 
19593 The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a
19594 storm-trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon went through
19595 the water with some precision again; and the course—for the present,
19596 East-south-east—which he was to steer, if practicable, was once more
19597 given to the helmsman. For during the violence of the gale, he had only
19598 steered according to its vicissitudes. But as he was now bringing the
19599 ship as near her course as possible, watching the compass meanwhile,
19600 lo! a good sign! the wind seemed coming round astern; aye, the foul
19601 breeze became fair!
19602 
19603 Instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of “_Ho! the fair
19604 wind! oh-ye-ho, cheerly men!_” the crew singing for joy, that so
19605 promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents
19606 preceding it.
19607 
19608 In compliance with the standing order of his commander—to report
19609 immediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided
19610 change in the affairs of the deck,—Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the
19611 yards to the breeze—however reluctantly and gloomily,—than he
19612 mechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance.
19613 
19614 Ere knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a
19615 moment. The cabin lamp—taking long swings this way and that—was burning
19616 fitfully, and casting fitful shadows upon the old man’s bolted door,—a
19617 thin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place of upper panels. The
19618 isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence
19619 to reign there, though it was hooped round by all the roar of the
19620 elements. The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed, as
19621 they stood upright against the forward bulkhead. Starbuck was an
19622 honest, upright man; but out of Starbuck’s heart, at that instant when
19623 he saw the muskets, there strangely evolved an evil thought; but so
19624 blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he
19625 hardly knew it for itself.
19626 
19627 “He would have shot me once,” he murmured, “yes, there’s the very
19628 musket that he pointed at me;—that one with the studded stock; let me
19629 touch it—lift it. Strange, that I, who have handled so many deadly
19630 lances, strange, that I should shake so now. Loaded? I must see. Aye,
19631 aye; and powder in the pan;—that’s not good. Best spill it?—wait. I’ll
19632 cure myself of this. I’ll hold the musket boldly while I think.—I come
19633 to report a fair wind to him. But how fair? Fair for death and
19634 doom,—_that’s_ fair for Moby Dick. It’s a fair wind that’s only fair
19635 for that accursed fish.—The very tube he pointed at me!—the very one;
19636 _this_ one—I hold it here; he would have killed me with the very thing
19637 I handle now.—Aye and he would fain kill all his crew. Does he not say
19638 he will not strike his spars to any gale? Has he not dashed his
19639 heavenly quadrant? and in these same perilous seas, gropes he not his
19640 way by mere dead reckoning of the error-abounding log? and in this very
19641 Typhoon, did he not swear that he would have no lightning-rods? But
19642 shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship’s
19643 company down to doom with him?—Yes, it would make him the wilful
19644 murderer of thirty men and more, if this ship come to any deadly harm;
19645 and come to deadly harm, my soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have
19646 his way. If, then, he were this instant—put aside, that crime would not
19647 be his. Ha! is he muttering in his sleep? Yes, just there,—in there,
19648 he’s sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again. I
19649 can’t withstand thee, then, old man. Not reasoning; not remonstrance;
19650 not entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this thou scornest. Flat
19651 obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou breathest. Aye,
19652 and say’st the men have vow’d thy vow; say’st all of us are Ahabs.
19653 Great God forbid!—But is there no other way? no lawful way?—Make him a
19654 prisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest this old man’s living
19655 power from his own living hands? Only a fool would try it. Say he were
19656 pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers; chained down to
19657 ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more hideous than a caged
19658 tiger, then. I could not endure the sight; could not possibly fly his
19659 howlings; all comfort, sleep itself, inestimable reason would leave me
19660 on the long intolerable voyage. What, then, remains? The land is
19661 hundreds of leagues away, and locked Japan the nearest. I stand alone
19662 here upon an open sea, with two oceans and a whole continent between me
19663 and law.—Aye, aye, ’tis so.—Is heaven a murderer when its lightning
19664 strikes a would-be murderer in his bed, tindering sheets and skin
19665 together?—And would I be a murderer, then, if”—and slowly, stealthily,
19666 and half sideways looking, he placed the loaded musket’s end against
19667 the door.
19668 
19669 “On this level, Ahab’s hammock swings within; his head this way. A
19670 touch, and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.—Oh
19671 Mary! Mary!—boy! boy! boy!—But if I wake thee not to death, old man,
19672 who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck’s body this day week may
19673 sink, with all the crew! Great God, where art Thou? Shall I? shall
19674 I?—The wind has gone down and shifted, sir; the fore and main topsails
19675 are reefed and set; she heads her course.”
19676 
19677 “Stern all! Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!”
19678 
19679 Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man’s
19680 tormented sleep, as if Starbuck’s voice had caused the long dumb dream
19681 to speak.
19682 
19683 The yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard’s arm against the panel;
19684 Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel; but turning from the door, he
19685 placed the death-tube in its rack, and left the place.
19686 
19687 “He’s too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go thou down, and wake him, and tell
19688 him. I must see to the deck here. Thou know’st what to say.”
19689 
19690 
19691 CHAPTER 124. The Needle.
19692 
19693 Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of
19694 mighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod’s gurgling track, pushed her on
19695 like giants’ palms outspread. The strong, unstaggering breeze abounded
19696 so, that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the whole world
19697 boomed before the wind. Muffled in the full morning light, the
19698 invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place;
19699 where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned
19700 Babylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything. The sea was as a
19701 crucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with light and heat.
19702 
19703 Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every time
19704 the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to
19705 eye the bright sun’s rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly
19706 settled by the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun’s rearward
19707 place, and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating
19708 wake.
19709 
19710 “Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot
19711 of the sun. Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun to
19712 ye! Yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the sea!”
19713 
19714 But suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards
19715 the helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.
19716 
19717 “East-sou-east, sir,” said the frightened steersman.
19718 
19719 “Thou liest!” smiting him with his clenched fist. “Heading East at this
19720 hour in the morning, and the sun astern?”
19721 
19722 Upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then
19723 observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its very
19724 blinding palpableness must have been the cause.
19725 
19726 Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one glimpse
19727 of the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment he almost
19728 seemed to stagger. Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two
19729 compasses pointed East, and the Pequod was as infallibly going West.
19730 
19731 But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the
19732 old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, “I have it! It has happened
19733 before. Mr. Starbuck, last night’s thunder turned our compasses—that’s
19734 all. Thou hast before now heard of such a thing, I take it.”
19735 
19736 “Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir,” said the pale mate,
19737 gloomily.
19738 
19739 Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than
19740 one case occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as
19741 developed in the mariner’s needle, is, as all know, essentially one
19742 with the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much
19743 marvelled at, that such things should be. Instances where the lightning
19744 has actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars
19745 and rigging, the effect upon the needle has at times been still more
19746 fatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before
19747 magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife’s knitting needle.
19748 But in either case, the needle never again, of itself, recovers the
19749 original virtue thus marred or lost; and if the binnacle compasses be
19750 affected, the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship;
19751 even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson.
19752 
19753 Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed
19754 compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took
19755 the precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were
19756 exactly inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship’s course to be
19757 changed accordingly. The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod
19758 thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair
19759 one had only been juggling her.
19760 
19761 Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said
19762 nothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and
19763 Flask—who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his
19764 feelings—likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced. As for the men, though some
19765 of them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear
19766 of Fate. But as ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost
19767 wholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only with a certain
19768 magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab’s.
19769 
19770 For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But
19771 chancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper
19772 sight-tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.
19773 
19774 “Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun’s pilot! yesterday I wrecked
19775 thee, and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me. So, so. But
19776 Ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet. Mr. Starbuck—a lance without
19777 a pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker’s needles.
19778 Quick!”
19779 
19780 Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about
19781 to do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to
19782 revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a
19783 matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses. Besides, the old
19784 man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily
19785 practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious
19786 sailors, without some shudderings and evil portents.
19787 
19788 “Men,” said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed him
19789 the things he had demanded, “my men, the thunder turned old Ahab’s
19790 needles; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own,
19791 that will point as true as any.”
19792 
19793 Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as
19794 this was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic
19795 might follow. But Starbuck looked away.
19796 
19797 With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the
19798 lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade
19799 him hold it upright, without its touching the deck. Then, with the
19800 maul, after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he
19801 placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly
19802 hammered that, several times, the mate still holding the rod as before.
19803 Then going through some small strange motions with it—whether
19804 indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to
19805 augment the awe of the crew, is uncertain—he called for linen thread;
19806 and moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there,
19807 and horizontally suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of
19808 the compass-cards. At first, the steel went round and round, quivering
19809 and vibrating at either end; but at last it settled to its place, when
19810 Ahab, who had been intently watching for this result, stepped frankly
19811 back from the binnacle, and pointing his stretched arm towards it,
19812 exclaimed,—“Look ye, for yourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the level
19813 loadstone! The sun is East, and that compass swears it!”
19814 
19815 One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could
19816 persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk
19817 away.
19818 
19819 In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his
19820 fatal pride.
19821 
19822 
19823 CHAPTER 125. The Log and Line.
19824 
19825 While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log
19826 and line had but very seldom been in use. Owing to a confident reliance
19827 upon other means of determining the vessel’s place, some merchantmen,
19828 and many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave
19829 the log; though at the same time, and frequently more for form’s sake
19830 than anything else, regularly putting down upon the customary slate the
19831 course steered by the ship, as well as the presumed average rate of
19832 progression every hour. It had been thus with the Pequod. The wooden
19833 reel and angular log attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the
19834 railing of the after bulwarks. Rains and spray had damped it; sun and
19835 wind had warped it; all the elements had combined to rot a thing that
19836 hung so idly. But heedless of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he
19837 happened to glance upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet
19838 scene, and he remembered how his quadrant was no more, and recalled his
19839 frantic oath about the level log and line. The ship was sailing
19840 plungingly; astern the billows rolled in riots.
19841 
19842 “Forward, there! Heave the log!”
19843 
19844 Two seamen came. The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman.
19845 “Take the reel, one of ye, I’ll heave.”
19846 
19847 They went towards the extreme stern, on the ship’s lee side, where the
19848 deck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping into
19849 the creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.
19850 
19851 The Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting
19852 handle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved, so
19853 stood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to
19854 him.
19855 
19856 Ahab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty
19857 turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old
19858 Manxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to
19859 speak.
19860 
19861 “Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have
19862 spoiled it.”
19863 
19864 “’Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat and wet, have they spoiled thee?
19865 Thou seem’st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not thou it.”
19866 
19867 “I hold the spool, sir. But just as my captain says. With these grey
19868 hairs of mine ’tis not worth while disputing, ’specially with a
19869 superior, who’ll ne’er confess.”
19870 
19871 “What’s that? There now’s a patched professor in Queen Nature’s
19872 granite-founded College; but methinks he’s too subservient. Where wert
19873 thou born?”
19874 
19875 “In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.”
19876 
19877 “Excellent! Thou’st hit the world by that.”
19878 
19879 “I know not, sir, but I was born there.”
19880 
19881 “In the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it’s good. Here’s a man
19882 from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of Man;
19883 which is sucked in—by what? Up with the reel! The dead, blind wall
19884 butts all inquiring heads at last. Up with it! So.”
19885 
19886 The log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long
19887 dragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl. In
19888 turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing
19889 resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely.
19890 
19891 “Hold hard!”
19892 
19893 Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the
19894 tugging log was gone.
19895 
19896 “I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad
19897 sea parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian;
19898 reel up, Manxman. And look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and
19899 mend thou the line. See to it.”
19900 
19901 “There he goes now; to him nothing’s happened; but to me, the skewer
19902 seems loosening out of the middle of the world. Haul in, haul in,
19903 Tahitian! These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and
19904 dragging slow. Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?”
19905 
19906 “Pip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pip’s missing.
19907 Let’s see now if ye haven’t fished him up here, fisherman. It drags
19908 hard; I guess he’s holding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off; we haul
19909 in no cowards here. Ho! there’s his arm just breaking water. A hatchet!
19910 a hatchet! cut it off—we haul in no cowards here. Captain Ahab! sir,
19911 sir! here’s Pip, trying to get on board again.”
19912 
19913 “Peace, thou crazy loon,” cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm.
19914 “Away from the quarter-deck!”
19915 
19916 “The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser,” muttered Ahab, advancing.
19917 “Hands off from that holiness! Where sayest thou Pip was, boy?
19918 
19919 “Astern there, sir, astern! Lo! lo!”
19920 
19921 “And who art thou, boy? I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of
19922 thy eyes. Oh God! that man should be a thing for immortal souls to
19923 sieve through! Who art thou, boy?”
19924 
19925 “Bell-boy, sir; ship’s-crier; ding, dong, ding! Pip! Pip! Pip! One
19926 hundred pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high—looks
19927 cowardly—quickest known by that! Ding, dong, ding! Who’s seen Pip the
19928 coward?”
19929 
19930 “There can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye frozen heavens!
19931 look down here. Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned
19932 him, ye creative libertines. Here, boy; Ahab’s cabin shall be Pip’s
19933 home henceforth, while Ahab lives. Thou touchest my inmost centre, boy;
19934 thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings. Come, let’s
19935 down.”
19936 
19937 “What’s this? here’s velvet shark-skin,” intently gazing at Ahab’s
19938 hand, and feeling it. “Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing
19939 as this, perhaps he had ne’er been lost! This seems to me, sir, as a
19940 man-rope; something that weak souls may hold by. Oh, sir, let old Perth
19941 now come and rivet these two hands together; the black one with the
19942 white, for I will not let this go.”
19943 
19944 “Oh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse
19945 horrors than are here. Come, then, to my cabin. Lo! ye believers in
19946 gods all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient gods
19947 oblivious of suffering man; and man, though idiotic, and knowing not
19948 what he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude. Come!
19949 I feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than though I grasped an
19950 Emperor’s!”
19951 
19952 “There go two daft ones now,” muttered the old Manxman. “One daft with
19953 strength, the other daft with weakness. But here’s the end of the
19954 rotten line—all dripping, too. Mend it, eh? I think we had best have a
19955 new line altogether. I’ll see Mr. Stubb about it.”
19956 
19957 
19958 CHAPTER 126. The Life-Buoy.
19959 
19960 Steering now south-eastward by Ahab’s levelled steel, and her progress
19961 solely determined by Ahab’s level log and line; the Pequod held on her
19962 path towards the Equator. Making so long a passage through such
19963 unfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways
19964 impelled by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously mild; all
19965 these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and
19966 desperate scene.
19967 
19968 At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the
19969 Equatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before
19970 the dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch—then
19971 headed by Flask—was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and
19972 unearthly—like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all Herod’s
19973 murdered Innocents—that one and all, they started from their reveries,
19974 and for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all
19975 transfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that wild
19976 cry remained within hearing. The Christian or civilized part of the
19977 crew said it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers
19978 remained unappalled. Yet the grey Manxman—the oldest mariner of
19979 all—declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard, were the
19980 voices of newly drowned men in the sea.
19981 
19982 Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when he
19983 came to the deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not
19984 unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings. He hollowly laughed, and thus
19985 explained the wonder.
19986 
19987 Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great
19988 numbers of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or
19989 some dams that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and
19990 kept company with her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of
19991 wail. But this only the more affected some of them, because most
19992 mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals, arising not
19993 only from their peculiar tones when in distress, but also from the
19994 human look of their round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen
19995 peeringly uprising from the water alongside. In the sea, under certain
19996 circumstances, seals have more than once been mistaken for men.
19997 
19998 But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible
19999 confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning. At
20000 sun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore;
20001 and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for
20002 sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was thus
20003 with the man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may, he had
20004 not been long at his perch, when a cry was heard—a cry and a
20005 rushing—and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and
20006 looking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the
20007 sea.
20008 
20009 The life-buoy—a long slender cask—was dropped from the stern, where it
20010 always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to seize it,
20011 and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so that it
20012 slowly filled, and that parched wood also filled at its every pore; and
20013 the studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom, as if to
20014 yield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.
20015 
20016 And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out
20017 for the White Whale, on the White Whale’s own peculiar ground; that man
20018 was swallowed up in the deep. But few, perhaps, thought of that at the
20019 time. Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at
20020 least as a portent; for they regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of
20021 evil in the future, but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged.
20022 They declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they
20023 had heard the night before. But again the old Manxman said nay.
20024 
20025 The lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to see
20026 to it; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and as in
20027 the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the
20028 voyage, all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly
20029 connected with its final end, whatever that might prove to be;
20030 therefore, they were going to leave the ship’s stern unprovided with a
20031 buoy, when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg hinted a
20032 hint concerning his coffin.
20033 
20034 “A life-buoy of a coffin!” cried Starbuck, starting.
20035 
20036 “Rather queer, that, I should say,” said Stubb.
20037 
20038 “It will make a good enough one,” said Flask, “the carpenter here can
20039 arrange it easily.”
20040 
20041 “Bring it up; there’s nothing else for it,” said Starbuck, after a
20042 melancholy pause. “Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me so—the coffin,
20043 I mean. Dost thou hear me? Rig it.”
20044 
20045 “And shall I nail down the lid, sir?” moving his hand as with a hammer.
20046 
20047 “Aye.”
20048 
20049 “And shall I caulk the seams, sir?” moving his hand as with a
20050 caulking-iron.
20051 
20052 “Aye.”
20053 
20054 “And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?” moving his hand
20055 as with a pitch-pot.
20056 
20057 “Away! what possesses thee to this? Make a life-buoy of the coffin, and
20058 no more.—Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me.”
20059 
20060 “He goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he
20061 baulks. Now I don’t like this. I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he
20062 wears it like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he
20063 won’t put his head into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with
20064 that coffin? And now I’m ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It’s like
20065 turning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on the other side now. I
20066 don’t like this cobbling sort of business—I don’t like it at all; it’s
20067 undignified; it’s not my place. Let tinkers’ brats do tinkerings; we
20068 are their betters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin,
20069 fair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at
20070 the beginning, and is at the middle when midway, and comes to an end at
20071 the conclusion; not a cobbler’s job, that’s at an end in the middle,
20072 and at the beginning at the end. It’s the old woman’s tricks to be
20073 giving cobbling jobs. Lord! what an affection all old women have for
20074 tinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away with a
20075 bald-headed young tinker once. And that’s the reason I never would work
20076 for lonely widow old women ashore, when I kept my job-shop in the
20077 Vineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run
20078 off with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let
20079 me see. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with
20080 pitch; batten them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over
20081 the ship’s stern. Were ever such things done before with a coffin? Some
20082 superstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere
20083 they would do the job. But I’m made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I
20084 don’t budge. Cruppered with a coffin! Sailing about with a grave-yard
20085 tray! But never mind. We workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and
20086 card-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. We work by the month, or
20087 by the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore
20088 of our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it
20089 if we can. Hem! I’ll do the job, now, tenderly. I’ll have me—let’s
20090 see—how many in the ship’s company, all told? But I’ve forgotten. Any
20091 way, I’ll have me thirty separate, Turk’s-headed life-lines, each three
20092 feet long hanging all round to the coffin. Then, if the hull go down,
20093 there’ll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight
20094 not seen very often beneath the sun! Come hammer, caulking-iron,
20095 pitch-pot, and marling-spike! Let’s to it.”
20096 
20097 
20098 CHAPTER 127. The Deck.
20099 
20100 _The coffin laid upon two line-tubs, between the vice-bench and the
20101 open hatchway; the Carpenter caulking its seams; the string of twisted
20102 oakum slowly unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of
20103 his frock.—Ahab comes slowly from the cabin-gangway, and hears Pip
20104 following him._
20105 
20106 “Back, lad; I will be with ye again presently. He goes! Not this hand
20107 complies with my humor more genially than that boy.—Middle aisle of a
20108 church! What’s here?”
20109 
20110 “Life-buoy, sir. Mr. Starbuck’s orders. Oh, look, sir! Beware the
20111 hatchway!”
20112 
20113 “Thank ye, man. Thy coffin lies handy to the vault.”
20114 
20115 “Sir? The hatchway? oh! So it does, sir, so it does.”
20116 
20117 “Art not thou the leg-maker? Look, did not this stump come from thy
20118 shop?”
20119 
20120 “I believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?”
20121 
20122 “Well enough. But art thou not also the undertaker?”
20123 
20124 “Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg; but
20125 they’ve set me now to turning it into something else.”
20126 
20127 “Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,
20128 monopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and the
20129 next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those
20130 same coffins? Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a
20131 jack-of-all-trades.”
20132 
20133 “But I do not mean anything, sir. I do as I do.”
20134 
20135 “The gods again. Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a
20136 coffin? The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the
20137 craters for volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade in
20138 hand. Dost thou never?”
20139 
20140 “Sing, sir? Do I sing? Oh, I’m indifferent enough, sir, for that; but
20141 the reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because there
20142 was none in his spade, sir. But the caulking mallet is full of it. Hark
20143 to it.”
20144 
20145 “Aye, and that’s because the lid there’s a sounding-board; and what in
20146 all things makes the sounding-board is this—there’s naught beneath. And
20147 yet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same, Carpenter.
20148 Hast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the coffin knock against
20149 the churchyard gate, going in?
20150 
20151 “Faith, sir, I’ve——”
20152 
20153 “Faith? What’s that?”
20154 
20155 “Why, faith, sir, it’s only a sort of exclamation-like—that’s all,
20156 sir.”
20157 
20158 “Um, um; go on.”
20159 
20160 “I was about to say, sir, that——”
20161 
20162 “Art thou a silk-worm? Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself?
20163 Look at thy bosom! Despatch! and get these traps out of sight.”
20164 
20165 “He goes aft. That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in hot
20166 latitudes. I’ve heard that the Isle of Albemarle, one of the
20167 Gallipagos, is cut by the Equator right in the middle. Seems to me some
20168 sort of Equator cuts yon old man, too, right in his middle. He’s always
20169 under the Line—fiery hot, I tell ye! He’s looking this way—come, oakum;
20170 quick. Here we go again. This wooden mallet is the cork, and I’m the
20171 professor of musical glasses—tap, tap!”
20172 
20173 (_Ahab to himself_.)
20174 
20175 “There’s a sight! There’s a sound! The greyheaded woodpecker tapping
20176 the hollow tree! Blind and dumb might well be envied now. See! that
20177 thing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines. A most malicious wag,
20178 that fellow. Rat-tat! So man’s seconds tick! Oh! how immaterial are all
20179 materials! What things real are there, but imponderable thoughts? Here
20180 now’s the very dreaded symbol of grim death, by a mere hap, made the
20181 expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life. A
20182 life-buoy of a coffin! Does it go further? Can it be that in some
20183 spiritual sense the coffin is, after all, but an immortality-preserver!
20184 I’ll think of that. But no. So far gone am I in the dark side of earth,
20185 that its other side, the theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain
20186 twilight to me. Will ye never have done, Carpenter, with that accursed
20187 sound? I go below; let me not see that thing here when I return again.
20188 Now, then, Pip, we’ll talk this over; I do suck most wondrous
20189 philosophies from thee! Some unknown conduits from the unknown worlds
20190 must empty into thee!”
20191 
20192 
20193 CHAPTER 128. The Pequod Meets The Rachel.
20194 
20195 Next day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly down
20196 upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men. At the time
20197 the Pequod was making good speed through the water; but as the
20198 broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all
20199 fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all life fled from
20200 the smitten hull.
20201 
20202 “Bad news; she brings bad news,” muttered the old Manxman. But ere her
20203 commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he
20204 could hopefully hail, Ahab’s voice was heard.
20205 
20206 “Hast seen the White Whale?”
20207 
20208 “Aye, yesterday. Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?”
20209 
20210 Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question;
20211 and would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger
20212 captain himself, having stopped his vessel’s way, was seen descending
20213 her side. A few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon clinched the
20214 Pequod’s main-chains, and he sprang to the deck. Immediately he was
20215 recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew. But no formal salutation
20216 was exchanged.
20217 
20218 “Where was he?—not killed!—not killed!” cried Ahab, closely advancing.
20219 “How was it?”
20220 
20221 It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous,
20222 while three of the stranger’s boats were engaged with a shoal of
20223 whales, which had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and
20224 while they were yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head
20225 of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to
20226 leeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boat—a reserved one—had been
20227 instantly lowered in chase. After a keen sail before the wind, this
20228 fourth boat—the swiftest keeled of all—seemed to have succeeded in
20229 fastening—at least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell
20230 anything about it. In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat;
20231 and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water; and after that nothing
20232 more; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have
20233 indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often happens. There was
20234 some apprehension, but no positive alarm, as yet. The recall signals
20235 were placed in the rigging; darkness came on; and forced to pick up her
20236 three far to windward boats—ere going in quest of the fourth one in the
20237 precisely opposite direction—the ship had not only been necessitated to
20238 leave that boat to its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to
20239 increase her distance from it. But the rest of her crew being at last
20240 safe aboard, she crowded all sail—stunsail on stunsail—after the
20241 missing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every
20242 other man aloft on the look-out. But though when she had thus sailed a
20243 sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when
20244 last seen; though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all
20245 around her; and not finding anything, had again dashed on; again
20246 paused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus continued doing
20247 till daylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been
20248 seen.
20249 
20250 The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his
20251 object in boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his
20252 own in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles
20253 apart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.
20254 
20255 “I will wager something now,” whispered Stubb to Flask, “that some one
20256 in that missing boat wore off that Captain’s best coat; mayhap, his
20257 watch—he’s so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard of two
20258 pious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height
20259 of the whaling season? See, Flask, only see how pale he looks—pale in
20260 the very buttons of his eyes—look—it wasn’t the coat—it must have been
20261 the—”
20262 
20263 “My boy, my own boy is among them. For God’s sake—I beg, I
20264 conjure”—here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far had
20265 but icily received his petition. “For eight-and-forty hours let me
20266 charter your ship—I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for it—if
20267 there be no other way—for eight-and-forty hours only—only that—you
20268 must, oh, you must, and you _shall_ do this thing.”
20269 
20270 “His son!” cried Stubb, “oh, it’s his son he’s lost! I take back the
20271 coat and watch—what says Ahab? We must save that boy.”
20272 
20273 “He’s drowned with the rest on ’em, last night,” said the old Manx
20274 sailor standing behind them; “I heard; all of ye heard their spirits.”
20275 
20276 Now, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the Rachel’s
20277 the more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of the
20278 Captain’s sons among the number of the missing boat’s crew; but among
20279 the number of the other boat’s crews, at the same time, but on the
20280 other hand, separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the
20281 chase, there had been still another son; as that for a time, the
20282 wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity;
20283 which was only solved for him by his chief mate’s instinctively
20284 adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies,
20285 that is, when placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always to
20286 pick up the majority first. But the captain, for some unknown
20287 constitutional reason, had refrained from mentioning all this, and not
20288 till forced to it by Ahab’s iciness did he allude to his one yet
20289 missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old, whose father with the
20290 earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer’s paternal love, had
20291 thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a
20292 vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor does it
20293 unfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of such
20294 tender age away from them, for a protracted three or four years’ voyage
20295 in some other ship than their own; so that their first knowledge of a
20296 whaleman’s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a
20297 father’s natural but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and
20298 concern.
20299 
20300 Meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab;
20301 and Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without
20302 the least quivering of his own.
20303 
20304 “I will not go,” said the stranger, “till you say _aye_ to me. Do to me
20305 as you would have me do to you in the like case. For _you_ too have a
20306 boy, Captain Ahab—though but a child, and nestling safely at home now—a
20307 child of your old age too—Yes, yes, you relent; I see it—run, run, men,
20308 now, and stand by to square in the yards.”
20309 
20310 “Avast,” cried Ahab—“touch not a rope-yarn”; then in a voice that
20311 prolongingly moulded every word—“Captain Gardiner, I will not do it.
20312 Even now I lose time. Good-bye, good-bye. God bless ye, man, and may I
20313 forgive myself, but I must go. Mr. Starbuck, look at the binnacle
20314 watch, and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all
20315 strangers: then brace forward again, and let the ship sail as before.”
20316 
20317 Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin,
20318 leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter
20319 rejection of his so earnest suit. But starting from his enchantment,
20320 Gardiner silently hurried to the side; more fell than stepped into his
20321 boat, and returned to his ship.
20322 
20323 Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel
20324 was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot,
20325 however small, on the sea. This way and that her yards were swung
20326 round; starboard and larboard, she continued to tack; now she beat
20327 against a head sea; and again it pushed her before it; while all the
20328 while, her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men, as three
20329 tall cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying among the boughs.
20330 
20331 But by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly
20332 saw that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without
20333 comfort. She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were
20334 not.
20335 
20336 
20337 CHAPTER 129. The Cabin.
20338 
20339 (_Ahab moving to go on deck; Pip catches him by the hand to follow._)
20340 
20341 “Lad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now. The hour is
20342 coming when Ahab would not scare thee from him, yet would not have thee
20343 by him. There is that in thee, poor lad, which I feel too curing to my
20344 malady. Like cures like; and for this hunt, my malady becomes my most
20345 desired health. Do thou abide below here, where they shall serve thee,
20346 as if thou wert the captain. Aye, lad, thou shalt sit here in my own
20347 screwed chair; another screw to it, thou must be.”
20348 
20349 “No, no, no! ye have not a whole body, sir; do ye but use poor me for
20350 your one lost leg; only tread upon me, sir; I ask no more, so I remain
20351 a part of ye.”
20352 
20353 “Oh! spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot in the fadeless
20354 fidelity of man!—and a black! and crazy!—but methinks like-cures-like
20355 applies to him too; he grows so sane again.”
20356 
20357 “They tell me, sir, that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip, whose
20358 drowned bones now show white, for all the blackness of his living skin.
20359 But I will never desert ye, sir, as Stubb did him. Sir, I must go with
20360 ye.”
20361 
20362 “If thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab’s purpose keels up in him.
20363 I tell thee no; it cannot be.”
20364 
20365 “Oh good master, master, master!
20366 
20367 “Weep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad.
20368 Listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck, and still
20369 know that I am there. And now I quit thee. Thy hand!—Met! True art
20370 thou, lad, as the circumference to its centre. So: God for ever bless
20371 thee; and if it come to that,—God for ever save thee, let what will
20372 befall.”
20373 
20374 (_Ahab goes; Pip steps one step forward._)
20375 
20376 “Here he this instant stood; I stand in his air,—but I’m alone. Now
20377 were even poor Pip here I could endure it, but he’s missing. Pip! Pip!
20378 Ding, dong, ding! Who’s seen Pip? He must be up here; let’s try the
20379 door. What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet there’s no opening
20380 it. It must be the spell; he told me to stay here: Aye, and told me
20381 this screwed chair was mine. Here, then, I’ll seat me, against the
20382 transom, in the ship’s full middle, all her keel and her three masts
20383 before me. Here, our old sailors say, in their black seventy-fours
20384 great admirals sometimes sit at table, and lord it over rows of
20385 captains and lieutenants. Ha! what’s this? epaulets! epaulets! the
20386 epaulets all come crowding! Pass round the decanters; glad to see ye;
20387 fill up, monsieurs! What an odd feeling, now, when a black boy’s host
20388 to white men with gold lace upon their coats!—Monsieurs, have ye seen
20389 one Pip?—a little negro lad, five feet high, hang-dog look, and
20390 cowardly! Jumped from a whale-boat once;—seen him? No! Well then, fill
20391 up again, captains, and let’s drink shame upon all cowards! I name no
20392 names. Shame upon them! Put one foot upon the table. Shame upon all
20393 cowards.—Hist! above there, I hear ivory—Oh, master! master! I am
20394 indeed down-hearted when you walk over me. But here I’ll stay, though
20395 this stern strikes rocks; and they bulge through; and oysters come to
20396 join me.”
20397 
20398 
20399 CHAPTER 130. The Hat.
20400 
20401 And now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a
20402 preliminary cruise, Ahab,—all other whaling waters swept—seemed to have
20403 chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely there;
20404 now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude
20405 where his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a vessel had
20406 been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered
20407 Moby Dick;—and now that all his successive meetings with various ships
20408 contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which
20409 the white whale tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned against;
20410 now it was that there lurked a something in the old man’s eyes, which
20411 it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see. As the unsetting
20412 polar star, which through the livelong, arctic, six months’ night
20413 sustains its piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab’s purpose now
20414 fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew. It
20415 domineered above them so, that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings,
20416 fears, were fain to hide beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a
20417 single spear or leaf.
20418 
20419 In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,
20420 vanished. Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more
20421 strove to check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed
20422 ground to finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped
20423 mortar of Ahab’s iron soul. Like machines, they dumbly moved about the
20424 deck, ever conscious that the old man’s despot eye was on them.
20425 
20426 But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours; when
20427 he thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have seen that
20428 even as Ahab’s eyes so awed the crew’s, the inscrutable Parsee’s glance
20429 awed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it.
20430 Such an added, gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah
20431 now; such ceaseless shudderings shook him; that the men looked dubious
20432 at him; half uncertain, as it seemed, whether indeed he were a mortal
20433 substance, or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen
20434 being’s body. And that shadow was always hovering there. For not by
20435 night, even, had Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber, or go
20436 below. He would stand still for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan
20437 but wondrous eyes did plainly say—We two watchmen never rest.
20438 
20439 Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the
20440 deck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole,
20441 or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits,—the
20442 main-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing in the
20443 cabin-scuttle,—his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if to step;
20444 his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however motionless he
20445 stood, however the days and nights were added on, that he had not swung
20446 in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never
20447 tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at
20448 times; or whether he was still intently scanning them; no matter,
20449 though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and
20450 the unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved
20451 coat and hat. The clothes that the night had wet, the next day’s
20452 sunshine dried upon him; and so, day after day, and night after night;
20453 he went no more beneath the planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin
20454 that thing he sent for.
20455 
20456 He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,—breakfast and
20457 dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly
20458 grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still
20459 grow idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdure. But
20460 though his whole life was now become one watch on deck; and though the
20461 Parsee’s mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these
20462 two never seemed to speak—one man to the other—unless at long intervals
20463 some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary. Though such a potent
20464 spell seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to the awe-struck
20465 crew, they seemed pole-like asunder. If by day they chanced to speak
20466 one word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the
20467 slightest verbal interchange. At times, for longest hours, without a
20468 single hail, they stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his
20469 scuttle, the Parsee by the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each
20470 other; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the
20471 Parsee his abandoned substance.
20472 
20473 And yet, somehow, did Ahab—in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,
20474 and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,—Ahab
20475 seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both
20476 seemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the lean
20477 shade siding the solid rib. For be this Parsee what he may, all rib and
20478 keel was solid Ahab.
20479 
20480 At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard
20481 from aft,—“Man the mast-heads!”—and all through the day, till after
20482 sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at the striking
20483 of the helmsman’s bell, was heard—“What d’ye see?—sharp! sharp!”
20484 
20485 But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the
20486 children-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac
20487 old man seemed distrustful of his crew’s fidelity; at least, of nearly
20488 all except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether
20489 Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought. But
20490 if these suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from
20491 verbally expressing them, however his actions might seem to hint them.
20492 
20493 “I will have the first sight of the whale myself,”—he said. “Aye! Ahab
20494 must have the doubloon!” and with his own hands he rigged a nest of
20495 basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved
20496 block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of the
20497 downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin
20498 for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with
20499 that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round
20500 upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long
20501 upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then
20502 settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,—“Take the
20503 rope, sir—I give it into thy hands, Starbuck.” Then arranging his
20504 person in the basket, he gave the word for them to hoist him to his
20505 perch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last; and
20506 afterwards stood near it. And thus, with one hand clinging round the
20507 royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles,—ahead,
20508 astern, this side, and that,—within the wide expanded circle commanded
20509 at so great a height.
20510 
20511 When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in
20512 the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is
20513 hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these
20514 circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict
20515 charge to some one man who has the special watch of it. Because in such
20516 a wilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations
20517 aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at
20518 the deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few
20519 minutes cast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural
20520 fatality, if, unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor
20521 should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all
20522 swooping to the sea. So Ahab’s proceedings in this matter were not
20523 unusual; the only strange thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck,
20524 almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with
20525 anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision—one of those
20526 too, whose faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt
20527 somewhat;—it was strange, that this was the very man he should select
20528 for his watchman; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise
20529 distrusted person’s hands.
20530 
20531 Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten
20532 minutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly
20533 incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these
20534 latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his
20535 head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a
20536 thousand feet straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards, and
20537 went eddying again round his head.
20538 
20539 But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed
20540 not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked
20541 it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least
20542 heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every
20543 sight.
20544 
20545 “Your hat, your hat, sir!” suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who
20546 being posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab, though
20547 somewhat lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air dividing
20548 them.
20549 
20550 But already the sable wing was before the old man’s eyes; the long
20551 hooked bill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away with
20552 his prize.
20553 
20554 An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin’s head, removing his cap to replace
20555 it, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin would be
20556 king of Rome. But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen
20557 accounted good. Ahab’s hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on
20558 and on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last disappeared;
20559 while from the point of that disappearance, a minute black spot was
20560 dimly discerned, falling from that vast height into the sea.
20561 
20562 
20563 CHAPTER 131. The Pequod Meets The Delight.
20564 
20565 The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the
20566 life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably
20567 misnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were
20568 fixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some
20569 whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine
20570 feet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.
20571 
20572 Upon the stranger’s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and
20573 some few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you
20574 now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled,
20575 half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.
20576 
20577 “Hast seen the White Whale?”
20578 
20579 “Look!” replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and with
20580 his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.
20581 
20582 “Hast killed him?”
20583 
20584 “The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that,” answered the
20585 other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose
20586 gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.
20587 
20588 “Not forged!” and snatching Perth’s levelled iron from the crotch, Ahab
20589 held it out, exclaiming—“Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this hand I hold
20590 his death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these
20591 barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the
20592 fin, where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!”
20593 
20594 “Then God keep thee, old man—see’st thou that”—pointing to the
20595 hammock—“I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only
20596 yesterday; but were dead ere night. Only _that_ one I bury; the rest
20597 were buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb.” Then turning
20598 to his crew—“Are ye ready there? place the plank then on the rail, and
20599 lift the body; so, then—Oh! God”—advancing towards the hammock with
20600 uplifted hands—“may the resurrection and the life——”
20601 
20602 “Brace forward! Up helm!” cried Ahab like lightning to his men.
20603 
20604 But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the
20605 sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea; not
20606 so quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have
20607 sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism.
20608 
20609 As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy
20610 hanging at the Pequod’s stern came into conspicuous relief.
20611 
20612 “Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!” cried a foreboding voice in her wake.
20613 “In vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us your
20614 taffrail to show us your coffin!”
20615 
20616 
20617 CHAPTER 132. The Symphony.
20618 
20619 It was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were
20620 hardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was
20621 transparently pure and soft, with a woman’s look, and the robust and
20622 man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson’s
20623 chest in his sleep.
20624 
20625 Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,
20626 unspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air;
20627 but to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed
20628 mighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong,
20629 troubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.
20630 
20631 But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and
20632 shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were,
20633 that distinguished them.
20634 
20635 Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle
20636 air to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. And at the
20637 girdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion—most seen
20638 here at the equator—denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving
20639 alarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.
20640 
20641 Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm
20642 and unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the
20643 ashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the
20644 morn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl’s
20645 forehead of heaven.
20646 
20647 Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! Invisible winged
20648 creatures that frolic all round us! Sweet childhood of air and sky! how
20649 oblivious were ye of old Ahab’s close-coiled woe! But so have I seen
20650 little Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around
20651 their old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on
20652 the marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.
20653 
20654 Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side
20655 and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the
20656 more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity. But the
20657 lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a
20658 moment, the cankerous thing in his soul. That glad, happy air, that
20659 winsome sky, did at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother world,
20660 so long cruel—forbidding—now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn
20661 neck, and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over one, that
20662 however wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her heart to save
20663 and to bless. From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into
20664 the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee
20665 drop.
20666 
20667 Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side;
20668 and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing
20669 that stole out of the centre of the serenity around. Careful not to
20670 touch him, or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and stood
20671 there.
20672 
20673 Ahab turned.
20674 
20675 “Starbuck!”
20676 
20677 “Sir.”
20678 
20679 “Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky. On such
20680 a day—very much such a sweetness as this—I struck my first whale—a
20681 boy-harpooneer of eighteen! Forty—forty—forty years ago!—ago! Forty
20682 years of continual whaling! forty years of privation, and peril, and
20683 storm-time! forty years on the pitiless sea! for forty years has Ahab
20684 forsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to make war on the horrors
20685 of the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not
20686 spent three ashore. When I think of this life I have led; the
20687 desolation of solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a
20688 Captain’s exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any
20689 sympathy from the green country without—oh, weariness! heaviness!
20690 Guinea-coast slavery of solitary command!—when I think of all this;
20691 only half-suspected, not so keenly known to me before—and how for forty
20692 years I have fed upon dry salted fare—fit emblem of the dry nourishment
20693 of my soil!—when the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily
20694 hand, and broken the world’s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts—away,
20695 whole oceans away, from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and
20696 sailed for Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage
20697 pillow—wife? wife?—rather a widow with her husband alive! Aye, I
20698 widowed that poor girl when I married her, Starbuck; and then, the
20699 madness, the frenzy, the boiling blood and the smoking brow, with
20700 which, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously, foamingly
20701 chased his prey—more a demon than a man!—aye, aye! what a forty years’
20702 fool—fool—old fool, has old Ahab been! Why this strife of the chase?
20703 why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance?
20704 how the richer or better is Ahab now? Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not
20705 hard, that with this weary load I bear, one poor leg should have been
20706 snatched from under me? Here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me,
20707 that I seem to weep. Locks so grey did never grow but from out some
20708 ashes! But do I look very old, so very, very old, Starbuck? I feel
20709 deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though I were Adam, staggering
20710 beneath the piled centuries since Paradise. God! God! God!—crack my
20711 heart!—stave my brain!—mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey
20712 hairs, have I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus
20713 intolerably old? Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a
20714 human eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to
20715 gaze upon God. By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is
20716 the magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no;
20717 stay on board, on board!—lower not when I do; when branded Ahab gives
20718 chase to Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with
20719 the far away home I see in that eye!”
20720 
20721 “Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all!
20722 why should any one give chase to that hated fish! Away with me! let us
20723 fly these deadly waters! let us home! Wife and child, too, are
20724 Starbuck’s—wife and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow
20725 youth; even as thine, sir, are the wife and child of thy loving,
20726 longing, paternal old age! Away! let us away!—this instant let me alter
20727 the course! How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl
20728 on our way to see old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they have some
20729 such mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket.”
20730 
20731 “They have, they have. I have seen them—some summer days in the
20732 morning. About this time—yes, it is his noon nap now—the boy
20733 vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of
20734 cannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back
20735 to dance him again.”
20736 
20737 “’Tis my Mary, my Mary herself! She promised that my boy, every
20738 morning, should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of
20739 his father’s sail! Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for
20740 Nantucket! Come, my Captain, study out the course, and let us away!
20741 See, see! the boy’s face from the window! the boy’s hand on the hill!”
20742 
20743 But Ahab’s glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook, and
20744 cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.
20745 
20746 “What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what
20747 cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor
20748 commands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep
20749 pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time; recklessly
20750 making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst not
20751 so much as dare? Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this
20752 arm? But if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an errand-boy
20753 in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some invisible
20754 power; how then can this one small heart beat; this one small brain
20755 think thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does
20756 that living, and not I. By heaven, man, we are turned round and round
20757 in this world, like yonder windlass, and Fate is the handspike. And all
20758 the time, lo! that smiling sky, and this unsounded sea! Look! see yon
20759 Albicore! who put it into him to chase and fang that flying-fish? Where
20760 do murderers go, man! Who’s to doom, when the judge himself is dragged
20761 to the bar? But it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and
20762 the air smells now, as if it blew from a far-away meadow; they have
20763 been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and
20764 the mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. Sleeping? Aye, toil we
20765 how we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep? Aye, and rust
20766 amid greenness; as last year’s scythes flung down, and left in the
20767 half-cut swaths—Starbuck!”
20768 
20769 But blanched to a corpse’s hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.
20770 
20771 Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at
20772 two reflected, fixed eyes in the water there. Fedallah was motionlessly
20773 leaning over the same rail.
20774 
20775 
20776 CHAPTER 133. The Chase—First Day.
20777 
20778 That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man—as his wont at
20779 intervals—stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and went
20780 to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing
20781 up the sea air as a sagacious ship’s dog will, in drawing nigh to some
20782 barbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be near. Soon that
20783 peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living
20784 sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any mariner
20785 surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vane,
20786 and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as
20787 possible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship’s course to be slightly
20788 altered, and the sail to be shortened.
20789 
20790 The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated
20791 at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and
20792 lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery
20793 wrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift
20794 tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.
20795 
20796 “Man the mast-heads! Call all hands!”
20797 
20798 Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle
20799 deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they
20800 seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear
20801 with their clothes in their hands.
20802 
20803 “What d’ye see?” cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.
20804 
20805 “Nothing, nothing sir!” was the sound hailing down in reply.
20806 
20807 “T’gallant sails!—stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!”
20808 
20809 All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for
20810 swaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were
20811 hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and
20812 while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the
20813 main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the
20814 air. “There she blows!—there she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is
20815 Moby Dick!”
20816 
20817 Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three
20818 look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous
20819 whale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final
20820 perch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just
20821 beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian’s
20822 head was almost on a level with Ahab’s heel. From this height the whale
20823 was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing
20824 his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout into
20825 the air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they
20826 had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.
20827 
20828 “And did none of ye see it before?” cried Ahab, hailing the perched men
20829 all around him.
20830 
20831 “I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I
20832 cried out,” said Tashtego.
20833 
20834 “Not the same instant; not the same—no, the doubloon is mine, Fate
20835 reserved the doubloon for me. _I_ only; none of ye could have raised
20836 the White Whale first. There she blows!—there she blows!—there she
20837 blows! There again!—there again!” he cried, in long-drawn, lingering,
20838 methodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale’s
20839 visible jets. “He’s going to sound! In stunsails! Down
20840 top-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay
20841 on board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So;
20842 steady, man, steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All
20843 ready the boats there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck;
20844 lower, lower,—quick, quicker!” and he slid through the air to the deck.
20845 
20846 “He is heading straight to leeward, sir,” cried Stubb, “right away from
20847 us; cannot have seen the ship yet.”
20848 
20849 “Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!—brace up!
20850 Shiver her!—shiver her!—So; well that! Boats, boats!”
20851 
20852 Soon all the boats but Starbuck’s were dropped; all the boat-sails
20853 set—all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to
20854 leeward; and Ahab heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up
20855 Fedallah’s sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.
20856 
20857 Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea;
20858 but only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew
20859 still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a
20860 noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter
20861 came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling
20862 hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated
20863 thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy,
20864 greenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly
20865 projecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged
20866 waters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky
20867 forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and
20868 behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving
20869 valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and
20870 danced by his side. But these were broken again by the light toes of
20871 hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate with their
20872 fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull
20873 of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected
20874 from the white whale’s back; and at intervals one of the cloud of
20875 soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over
20876 the fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail
20877 feathers streaming like pennons.
20878 
20879 A gentle joyousness—a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested
20880 the gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with
20881 ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering
20882 eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness,
20883 rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that
20884 great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so
20885 divinely swam.
20886 
20887 On each soft side—coincident with the parted swell, that but once
20888 leaving him, then flowed so wide away—on each bright side, the whale
20889 shed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who
20890 namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured
20891 to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of
20892 tornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all
20893 who for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way
20894 thou may’st have bejuggled and destroyed before.
20895 
20896 And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among
20897 waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby
20898 Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his
20899 submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw.
20900 But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an
20901 instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia’s
20902 Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air,
20903 the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight.
20904 Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls
20905 longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.
20906 
20907 With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,
20908 the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick’s reappearance.
20909 
20910 “An hour,” said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat’s stern; and he gazed
20911 beyond the whale’s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing
20912 vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed
20913 whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze
20914 now freshened; the sea began to swell.
20915 
20916 “The birds!—the birds!” cried Tashtego.
20917 
20918 In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now
20919 all flying towards Ahab’s boat; and when within a few yards began
20920 fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous,
20921 expectant cries. Their vision was keener than man’s; Ahab could
20922 discover no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down
20923 into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a
20924 white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it
20925 rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long
20926 crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the
20927 undiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dick’s open mouth and scrolled jaw;
20928 his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea.
20929 The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble
20930 tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled
20931 the craft aside from this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon
20932 Fedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and
20933 seizing Perth’s harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and
20934 stand by to stern.
20935 
20936 Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,
20937 its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale’s head while yet
20938 under water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that
20939 malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted
20940 himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head
20941 lengthwise beneath the boat.
20942 
20943 Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for
20944 an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a
20945 biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his
20946 mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into
20947 the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish
20948 pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab’s
20949 head, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the White Whale
20950 now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With
20951 unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the
20952 tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other’s heads to gain the
20953 uttermost stern.
20954 
20955 And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the
20956 whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his
20957 body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from
20958 the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while
20959 the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis
20960 impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with
20961 this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and
20962 helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized
20963 the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from
20964 its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the
20965 frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an
20966 enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in
20967 twain, and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the
20968 two floating wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the
20969 crew at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold
20970 fast to the oars to lash them across.
20971 
20972 At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first
20973 to perceive the whale’s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a
20974 movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had
20975 made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only
20976 slipping further into the whale’s mouth, and tilting over sideways as
20977 it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him
20978 out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the
20979 sea.
20980 
20981 Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little
20982 distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the
20983 billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body;
20984 so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose—some twenty or more feet
20985 out of the water—the now rising swells, with all their confluent waves,
20986 dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered spray
20987 still higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled Channel
20988 billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly to
20989 overleap its summit with their scud.
20990 
20991 *This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its
20992 designation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary
20993 up-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called
20994 pitchpoling, previously described. By this motion the whale must best
20995 and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him.
20996 
20997 But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round
20998 and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful
20999 wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly
21000 assault. The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the
21001 blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus’s elephants in the
21002 book of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the
21003 whale’s insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,—though he
21004 could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that;
21005 helpless Ahab’s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least
21006 chance shock might burst. From the boat’s fragmentary stern, Fedallah
21007 incuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other
21008 drifting end, could not succor him; more than enough was it for them to
21009 look to themselves. For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale’s
21010 aspect, and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made,
21011 that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them. And though the other
21012 boats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into
21013 the eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant
21014 destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that
21015 case could they themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes, then,
21016 they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had
21017 now become the old man’s head.
21018 
21019 Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship’s
21020 mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene;
21021 and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!—“Sail on
21022 the”—but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and
21023 whelmed him for the time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing
21024 to rise on a towering crest, he shouted,—“Sail on the whale!—Drive him
21025 off!”
21026 
21027 The Pequod’s prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle,
21028 she effectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly
21029 swam off, the boats flew to the rescue.
21030 
21031 Dragged into Stubb’s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white
21032 brine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab’s bodily
21033 strength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body’s doom: for a
21034 time, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb’s boat, like one trodden
21035 under foot of herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from
21036 him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.
21037 
21038 But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more
21039 abbreviate it. In an instant’s compass, great hearts sometimes condense
21040 to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused
21041 through feebler men’s whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary
21042 in each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time
21043 aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous
21044 intensities; for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures
21045 contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.
21046 
21047 “The harpoon,” said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on
21048 one bended arm—“is it safe?”
21049 
21050 “Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,” said Stubb, showing it.
21051 
21052 “Lay it before me;—any missing men?”
21053 
21054 “One, two, three, four, five;—there were five oars, sir, and here are
21055 five men.”
21056 
21057 “That’s good.—Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him! there!
21058 there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!—Hands off from me!
21059 The eternal sap runs up in Ahab’s bones again! Set the sail; out oars;
21060 the helm!”
21061 
21062 It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked
21063 up by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is
21064 thus continued with what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now.
21065 But the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the
21066 whale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with
21067 a velocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these
21068 circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an indefinitely
21069 prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long
21070 a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing
21071 barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself,
21072 then, as it sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate
21073 means of overtaking the chase. Accordingly, the boats now made for her,
21074 and were soon swayed up to their cranes—the two parts of the wrecked
21075 boat having been previously secured by her—and then hoisting everything
21076 to her side, and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways
21077 outstretching it with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an
21078 albatross; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At
21079 the well known, methodic intervals, the whale’s glittering spout was
21080 regularly announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be
21081 reported as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing
21082 the deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the
21083 allotted hour expired, his voice was heard.—“Whose is the doubloon now?
21084 D’ye see him?” and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he commanded
21085 them to lift him to his perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now
21086 aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the planks.
21087 
21088 As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men
21089 aloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a
21090 still greater breadth—thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat,
21091 at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped
21092 upon the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to shattered
21093 stern. At last he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded
21094 sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old
21095 man’s face there now stole some such added gloom as this.
21096 
21097 Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to
21098 evince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in
21099 his Captain’s mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed—“The
21100 thistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too keenly, sir; ha! ha!”
21101 
21102 “What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck? Man, man! did
21103 I not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I could
21104 swear thou wert a poltroon. Groan nor laugh should be heard before a
21105 wreck.”
21106 
21107 “Aye, sir,” said Starbuck drawing near, “’tis a solemn sight; an omen,
21108 and an ill one.”
21109 
21110 “Omen? omen?—the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to
21111 man, they will honorably speak outright; not shake their heads, and
21112 give an old wives’ darkling hint.—Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles
21113 of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye
21114 two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the
21115 peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors! Cold, cold—I shiver!—How
21116 now? Aloft there! D’ye see him? Sing out for every spout, though he
21117 spout ten times a second!”
21118 
21119 The day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling.
21120 Soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still remained unset.
21121 
21122 “Can’t see the spout now, sir;—too dark”—cried a voice from the air.
21123 
21124 “How heading when last seen?”
21125 
21126 “As before, sir,—straight to leeward.”
21127 
21128 “Good! he will travel slower now ’tis night. Down royals and
21129 top-gallant stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck. We must not run over him before
21130 morning; he’s making a passage now, and may heave-to a while. Helm
21131 there! keep her full before the wind!—Aloft! come down!—Mr. Stubb, send
21132 a fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned till
21133 morning.”—Then advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast—“Men,
21134 this gold is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let it abide here till
21135 the White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye first raises him,
21136 upon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that man’s; and if on
21137 that day I shall again raise him, then, ten times its sum shall be
21138 divided among all of ye! Away now!—the deck is thine, sir!”
21139 
21140 And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and
21141 slouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals
21142 rousing himself to see how the night wore on.
21143 
21144 
21145 CHAPTER 134. The Chase—Second Day.
21146 
21147 At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.
21148 
21149 “D’ye see him?” cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light
21150 to spread.
21151 
21152 “See nothing, sir.”
21153 
21154 “Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought
21155 for;—the top-gallant sails!—aye, they should have been kept on her all
21156 night. But no matter—’tis but resting for the rush.”
21157 
21158 Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular
21159 whale, continued through day into night, and through night into day, is
21160 a thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is
21161 the wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible
21162 confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket
21163 commanders; that from the simple observation of a whale when last
21164 descried, they will, under certain given circumstances, pretty
21165 accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to
21166 swim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable rate of
21167 progression during that period. And, in these cases, somewhat as a
21168 pilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose general trending he
21169 well knows, and which he desires shortly to return to again, but at
21170 some further point; like as this pilot stands by his compass, and takes
21171 the precise bearing of the cape at present visible, in order the more
21172 certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen headland, eventually to be
21173 visited: so does the fisherman, at his compass, with the whale; for
21174 after being chased, and diligently marked, through several hours of
21175 daylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the creature’s future
21176 wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious
21177 mind of the hunter, as the pilot’s coast is to him. So that to this
21178 hunter’s wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in
21179 water, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the
21180 steadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway
21181 is so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their
21182 hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby’s pulse; and lightly
21183 say of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a
21184 spot, at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions
21185 when these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep,
21186 according to the observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so
21187 many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have
21188 about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to
21189 render this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the
21190 sea must be the whaleman’s allies; for of what present avail to the
21191 becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is
21192 exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port? Inferable
21193 from these statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching the
21194 chase of whales.
21195 
21196 The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a
21197 cannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level
21198 field.
21199 
21200 “By salt and hemp!” cried Stubb, “but this swift motion of the deck
21201 creeps up one’s legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I are two
21202 brave fellows!—Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise,
21203 on the sea,—for by live-oaks! my spine’s a keel. Ha, ha! we go the gait
21204 that leaves no dust behind!”
21205 
21206 “There she blows—she blows!—she blows!—right ahead!” was now the
21207 mast-head cry.
21208 
21209 “Aye, aye!” cried Stubb, “I knew it—ye can’t escape—blow on and split
21210 your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow your
21211 trump—blister your lungs!—Ahab will dam off your blood, as a miller
21212 shuts his watergate upon the stream!”
21213 
21214 And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The frenzies
21215 of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine
21216 worked anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might
21217 have felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the
21218 growing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed,
21219 as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand
21220 of Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of the
21221 previous day; the rack of the past night’s suspense; the fixed,
21222 unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging
21223 towards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled
21224 along. The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the
21225 vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of
21226 that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race.
21227 
21228 They were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all;
21229 though it was put together of all contrasting things—oak, and maple,
21230 and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp—yet all these ran into each
21231 other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced
21232 and directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities
21233 of the crew, this man’s valor, that man’s fear; guilt and guiltiness,
21234 all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that
21235 fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.
21236 
21237 The rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were
21238 outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one
21239 hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others,
21240 shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking
21241 yards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for
21242 their fate. Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to
21243 seek out the thing that might destroy them!
21244 
21245 “Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?” cried Ahab, when, after
21246 the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard.
21247 “Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd
21248 jet that way, and then disappears.”
21249 
21250 It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some
21251 other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for
21252 hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its
21253 pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the
21254 air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant
21255 halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as—much nearer to the ship
21256 than the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead—Moby Dick
21257 bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not
21258 by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the
21259 White Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous
21260 phenomenon of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the
21261 furthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the
21262 pure element of air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows
21263 his place to the distance of seven miles and more. In those moments,
21264 the torn, enraged waves he shakes off, seem his mane; in some cases,
21265 this breaching is his act of defiance.
21266 
21267 “There she breaches! there she breaches!” was the cry, as in his
21268 immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to
21269 Heaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved
21270 against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,
21271 for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and
21272 stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling
21273 intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.
21274 
21275 “Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!” cried Ahab, “thy hour
21276 and thy harpoon are at hand!—Down! down all of ye, but one man at the
21277 fore. The boats!—stand by!”
21278 
21279 Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like
21280 shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and
21281 halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped
21282 from his perch.
21283 
21284 “Lower away,” he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat—a spare one,
21285 rigged the afternoon previous. “Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine—keep
21286 away from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!”
21287 
21288 As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first
21289 assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the
21290 three crews. Ahab’s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told
21291 them he would take the whale head-and-head,—that is, pull straight up
21292 to his forehead,—a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit,
21293 such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale’s sidelong
21294 vision. But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three
21295 boats were plain as the ship’s three masts to his eye; the White Whale
21296 churning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were,
21297 rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered
21298 appalling battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him
21299 from every boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank
21300 of which those boats were made. But skilfully manœuvred, incessantly
21301 wheeling like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while
21302 eluded him; though, at times, but by a plank’s breadth; while all the
21303 time, Ahab’s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.
21304 
21305 But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed
21306 and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three
21307 lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves,
21308 warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now
21309 for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more
21310 tremendous charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more
21311 line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again—hoping
21312 that way to disencumber it of some snarls—when lo!—a sight more savage
21313 than the embattled teeth of sharks!
21314 
21315 Caught and twisted—corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons
21316 and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing
21317 and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab’s boat. Only one
21318 thing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached
21319 within—through—and then, without—the rays of steel; dragged in the line
21320 beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice sundering
21321 the rope near the chocks—dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into
21322 the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the White Whale made a
21323 sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines; by so
21324 doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask
21325 towards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a
21326 surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a
21327 boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of
21328 the wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly
21329 stirred bowl of punch.
21330 
21331 While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after
21332 the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while
21333 aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching
21334 his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was
21335 lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old
21336 man’s line—now parting—admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to
21337 rescue whom he could;—in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand
21338 concreted perils,—Ahab’s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards
21339 Heaven by invisible wires,—as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly
21340 from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its
21341 bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell
21342 again—gunwale downwards—and Ahab and his men struggled out from under
21343 it, like seals from a sea-side cave.
21344 
21345 The first uprising momentum of the whale—modifying its direction as he
21346 struck the surface—involuntarily launched him along it, to a little
21347 distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with his
21348 back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from
21349 side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip or
21350 crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and
21351 came sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work
21352 for that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the
21353 ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his
21354 leeward way at a traveller’s methodic pace.
21355 
21356 As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again
21357 came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the
21358 floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,
21359 and safely landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists,
21360 and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;
21361 inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these
21362 were there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen
21363 any one. As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly
21364 clinging to his boat’s broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy
21365 float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day’s mishap.
21366 
21367 But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as
21368 instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of
21369 Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory
21370 leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.
21371 
21372 “Aye, aye, Starbuck, ’tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he
21373 will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.”
21374 
21375 “The ferrule has not stood, sir,” said the carpenter, now coming up; “I
21376 put good work into that leg.”
21377 
21378 “But no bones broken, sir, I hope,” said Stubb with true concern.
21379 
21380 “Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!—d’ye see it.—But even with a
21381 broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living bone of
21382 mine one jot more me, than this dead one that’s lost. Nor white whale,
21383 nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and
21384 inaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape
21385 yonder roof?—Aloft there! which way?”
21386 
21387 “Dead to leeward, sir.”
21388 
21389 “Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of
21390 the spare boats and rig them—Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the boat’s
21391 crews.”
21392 
21393 “Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.”
21394 
21395 “Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the
21396 unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!”
21397 
21398 “Sir?”
21399 
21400 “My body, man, not thee. Give me something for a cane—there, that
21401 shivered lance will do. Muster the men. Surely I have not seen him yet.
21402 By heaven it cannot be!—missing?—quick! call them all.”
21403 
21404 The old man’s hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the company, the
21405 Parsee was not there.
21406 
21407 “The Parsee!” cried Stubb—“he must have been caught in——”
21408 
21409 “The black vomit wrench thee!—run all of ye above, alow, cabin,
21410 forecastle—find him—not gone—not gone!”
21411 
21412 But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was
21413 nowhere to be found.
21414 
21415 “Aye, sir,” said Stubb—“caught among the tangles of your line—I thought
21416 I saw him dragging under.”
21417 
21418 “_My_ line! _my_ line? Gone?—gone? What means that little word?—What
21419 death-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry.
21420 The harpoon, too!—toss over the litter there,—d’ye see it?—the forged
21421 iron, men, the white whale’s—no, no, no,—blistered fool! this hand did
21422 dart it!—’tis in the fish!—Aloft there! Keep him nailed—Quick!—all
21423 hands to the rigging of the boats—collect the oars—harpooneers! the
21424 irons, the irons!—hoist the royals higher—a pull on all the
21425 sheets!—helm there! steady, steady for your life! I’ll ten times girdle
21426 the unmeasured globe; yea and dive straight through it, but I’ll slay
21427 him yet!”
21428 
21429 “Great God! but for one single instant show thyself,” cried Starbuck;
21430 “never, never wilt thou capture him, old man—In Jesus’ name no more of
21431 this, that’s worse than devil’s madness. Two days chased; twice stove
21432 to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee; thy evil
21433 shadow gone—all good angels mobbing thee with warnings:—what more
21434 wouldst thou have?—Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he
21435 swamps the last man? Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the
21436 sea? Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world? Oh, oh,—Impiety
21437 and blasphemy to hunt him more!”
21438 
21439 “Starbuck, of late I’ve felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that
21440 hour we both saw—thou know’st what, in one another’s eyes. But in this
21441 matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this
21442 hand—a lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab, man. This
21443 whole act’s immutably decreed. ’Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion
21444 years before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates’ lieutenant; I act
21445 under orders. Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest mine.—Stand round
21446 me, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the stump; leaning on a shivered
21447 lance; propped up on a lonely foot. ’Tis Ahab—his body’s part; but
21448 Ahab’s soul’s a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs. I feel
21449 strained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a
21450 gale; and I may look so. But ere I break, ye’ll hear me crack; and till
21451 ye hear _that_, know that Ahab’s hawser tows his purpose yet. Believe
21452 ye, men, in the things called omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry encore!
21453 For ere they drown, drowning things will twice rise to the surface;
21454 then rise again, to sink for evermore. So with Moby Dick—two days he’s
21455 floated—tomorrow will be the third. Aye, men, he’ll rise once more,—but
21456 only to spout his last! D’ye feel brave men, brave?”
21457 
21458 “As fearless fire,” cried Stubb.
21459 
21460 “And as mechanical,” muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward, he
21461 muttered on: “The things called omens! And yesterday I talked the same
21462 to Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I seek
21463 to drive out of others’ hearts what’s clinched so fast in mine!—The
21464 Parsee—the Parsee!—gone, gone? and he was to go before:—but still was
21465 to be seen again ere I could perish—How’s that?—There’s a riddle now
21466 might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of
21467 judges:—like a hawk’s beak it pecks my brain. _I’ll_, _I’ll_ solve it,
21468 though!”
21469 
21470 When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.
21471 
21472 So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as on
21473 the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the
21474 grindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by
21475 lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and
21476 sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow. Meantime, of the broken
21477 keel of Ahab’s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while
21478 still as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his
21479 scuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its
21480 dial; sat due eastward for the earliest sun.
21481 
21482 
21483 CHAPTER 135. The Chase.—Third Day.
21484 
21485 The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the
21486 solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the
21487 daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.
21488 
21489 “D’ye see him?” cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.
21490 
21491 “In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that’s all. Helm
21492 there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely day
21493 again! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the
21494 angels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a
21495 fairer day could not dawn upon that world. Here’s food for thought, had
21496 Ahab time to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels;
21497 _that’s_ tingling enough for mortal man! to think’s audacity. God only
21498 has that right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness
21499 and a calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too
21500 much for that. And yet, I’ve sometimes thought my brain was very
21501 calm—frozen calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the
21502 contents turned to ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is growing
21503 now; this moment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it’s like
21504 that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy
21505 clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds blow
21506 it; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the
21507 tossed ship they cling to. A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this
21508 through prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and
21509 ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces.
21510 Out upon it!—it’s tainted. Were I the wind, I’d blow no more on such a
21511 wicked, miserable world. I’d crawl somewhere to a cave, and slink
21512 there. And yet, ’tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who ever
21513 conquered it? In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow. Run
21514 tilting at it, and you but run through it. Ha! a coward wind that
21515 strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow.
21516 Even Ahab is a braver thing—a nobler thing than _that_. Would now the
21517 wind but had a body; but all the things that most exasperate and
21518 outrage mortal man, all these things are bodiless, but only bodiless as
21519 objects, not as agents. There’s a most special, a most cunning, oh, a
21520 most malicious difference! And yet, I say again, and swear it now, that
21521 there’s something all glorious and gracious in the wind. These warm
21522 Trade Winds, at least, that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in
21523 strong and steadfast, vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark,
21524 however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest
21525 Mississippies of the land swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go
21526 at last. And by the eternal Poles! these same Trades that so directly
21527 blow my good ship on; these Trades, or something like them—something so
21528 unchangeable, and full as strong, blow my keeled soul along! To it!
21529 Aloft there! What d’ye see?”
21530 
21531 “Nothing, sir.”
21532 
21533 “Nothing! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-begging! See the sun!
21534 Aye, aye, it must be so. I’ve oversailed him. How, got the start? Aye,
21535 he’s chasing _me_ now; not I, _him_—that’s bad; I might have known it,
21536 too. Fool! the lines—the harpoons he’s towing. Aye, aye, I have run him
21537 by last night. About! about! Come down, all of ye, but the regular look
21538 outs! Man the braces!”
21539 
21540 Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod’s
21541 quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced
21542 ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own
21543 white wake.
21544 
21545 “Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw,” murmured Starbuck to
21546 himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail. “God
21547 keep us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the inside
21548 wet my flesh. I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him!”
21549 
21550 “Stand by to sway me up!” cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket.
21551 “We should meet him soon.”
21552 
21553 “Aye, aye, sir,” and straightway Starbuck did Ahab’s bidding, and once
21554 more Ahab swung on high.
21555 
21556 A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now held
21557 long breaths with keen suspense. But at last, some three points off the
21558 weather bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly from the
21559 three mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had
21560 voiced it.
21561 
21562 “Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck
21563 there!—brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind’s eye. He’s too far
21564 off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck. The sails shake! Stand over that
21565 helmsman with a top-maul! So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But
21566 let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea; there’s
21567 time for that. An old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and
21568 not changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy, from the sand-hills of
21569 Nantucket! The same!—the same!—the same to Noah as to me. There’s a
21570 soft shower to leeward. Such lovely leewardings! They must lead
21571 somewhere—to something else than common land, more palmy than the
21572 palms. Leeward! the white whale goes that way; look to windward, then;
21573 the better if the bitterer quarter. But good bye, good bye, old
21574 mast-head! What’s this?—green? aye, tiny mosses in these warped cracks.
21575 No such green weather stains on Ahab’s head! There’s the difference now
21576 between man’s old age and matter’s. But aye, old mast, we both grow old
21577 together; sound in our hulls, though, are we not, my ship? Aye, minus a
21578 leg, that’s all. By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live
21579 flesh every way. I can’t compare with it; and I’ve known some ships
21580 made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital
21581 stuff of vital fathers. What’s that he said? he should still go before
21582 me, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? But where? Will I have eyes at
21583 the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and
21584 all night I’ve been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to. Aye,
21585 aye, like many more thou told’st direful truth as touching thyself, O
21586 Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short. Good-bye, mast-head—keep
21587 a good eye upon the whale, the while I’m gone. We’ll talk to-morrow,
21588 nay, to-night, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and
21589 tail.”
21590 
21591 He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered
21592 through the cloven blue air to the deck.
21593 
21594 In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop’s
21595 stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the
21596 mate,—who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck—and bade him pause.
21597 
21598 “Starbuck!”
21599 
21600 “Sir?”
21601 
21602 “For the third time my soul’s ship starts upon this voyage, Starbuck.”
21603 
21604 “Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so.”
21605 
21606 “Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,
21607 Starbuck!”
21608 
21609 “Truth, sir: saddest truth.”
21610 
21611 “Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the
21612 flood;—and I feel now like a billow that’s all one crested comb,
21613 Starbuck. I am old;—shake hands with me, man.”
21614 
21615 Their hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck’s tears the glue.
21616 
21617 “Oh, my captain, my captain!—noble heart—go not—go not!—see, it’s a
21618 brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion then!”
21619 
21620 “Lower away!”—cried Ahab, tossing the mate’s arm from him. “Stand by
21621 the crew!”
21622 
21623 In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.
21624 
21625 “The sharks! the sharks!” cried a voice from the low cabin-window
21626 there; “O master, my master, come back!”
21627 
21628 But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and the
21629 boat leaped on.
21630 
21631 Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when
21632 numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath
21633 the hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars, every time
21634 they dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied the boat with
21635 their bites. It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale-boats
21636 in those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them
21637 in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of
21638 marching regiments in the east. But these were the first sharks that
21639 had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first
21640 descried; and whether it was that Ahab’s crew were all such
21641 tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the
21642 senses of the sharks—a matter sometimes well known to affect
21643 them,—however it was, they seemed to follow that one boat without
21644 molesting the others.
21645 
21646 “Heart of wrought steel!” murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and
21647 following with his eyes the receding boat—“canst thou yet ring boldly
21648 to that sight?—lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and followed by
21649 them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical third day?—For
21650 when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit; be
21651 sure the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the third the
21652 evening and the end of that thing—be that end what it may. Oh! my God!
21653 what is this that shoots through me, and leaves me so deadly calm, yet
21654 expectant,—fixed at the top of a shudder! Future things swim before me,
21655 as in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past is somehow grown dim.
21656 Mary, girl! thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy! I seem to see
21657 but thy eyes grown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life seem
21658 clearing; but clouds sweep between—Is my journey’s end coming? My legs
21659 feel faint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,—beats
21660 it yet? Stir thyself, Starbuck!—stave it off—move, move! speak
21661 aloud!—Mast-head there! See ye my boy’s hand on the hill?—Crazed;—aloft
21662 there!—keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:—mark well the whale!—Ho!
21663 again!—drive off that hawk! see! he pecks—he tears the vane”—pointing
21664 to the red flag flying at the main-truck—“Ha! he soars away with
21665 it!—Where’s the old man now? see’st thou that sight, oh Ahab!—shudder,
21666 shudder!”
21667 
21668 The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-heads—a
21669 downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had sounded; but
21670 intending to be near him at the next rising, he held on his way a
21671 little sideways from the vessel; the becharmed crew maintaining the
21672 profoundest silence, as the head-beat waves hammered and hammered
21673 against the opposing bow.
21674 
21675 “Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads
21676 drive them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and
21677 no hearse can be mine:—and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!”
21678 
21679 Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then
21680 quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice,
21681 swiftly rising to the surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a
21682 subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with
21683 trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise,
21684 but obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist,
21685 it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping
21686 back into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for
21687 an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of
21688 flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the
21689 marble trunk of the whale.
21690 
21691 “Give way!” cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to
21692 the attack; but maddened by yesterday’s fresh irons that corroded in
21693 him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell
21694 from heaven. The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad
21695 white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together;
21696 as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and once more
21697 flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from the two
21698 mates’ boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows,
21699 but leaving Ahab’s almost without a scar.
21700 
21701 While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the
21702 whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he
21703 shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round
21704 and round to the fish’s back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in
21705 which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of
21706 the lines around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his
21707 sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old
21708 Ahab.
21709 
21710 The harpoon dropped from his hand.
21711 
21712 “Befooled, befooled!”—drawing in a long lean breath—“Aye, Parsee! I see
21713 thee again.—Aye, and thou goest before; and this, _this_ then is the
21714 hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last letter of
21715 thy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship! those
21716 boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to me;
21717 if not, Ahab is enough to die—Down, men! the first thing that but
21718 offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon. Ye are
21719 not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.—Where’s the
21720 whale? gone down again?”
21721 
21722 But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the
21723 corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter
21724 had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again
21725 steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed the ship,—which thus
21726 far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the
21727 present her headway had been stopped. He seemed swimming with his
21728 utmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight
21729 path in the sea.
21730 
21731 “Oh! Ahab,” cried Starbuck, “not too late is it, even now, the third
21732 day, to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that
21733 madly seekest him!”
21734 
21735 Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled
21736 to leeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding
21737 by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck’s face as he
21738 leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and
21739 follow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards,
21740 he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three
21741 mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats
21742 which had but just been hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in
21743 repairing them. One after the other, through the port-holes, as he
21744 sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying
21745 themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all
21746 this; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers
21747 seemed driving a nail into his heart. But he rallied. And now marking
21748 that the vane or flag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to
21749 Tashtego, who had just gained that perch, to descend again for another
21750 flag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to the mast.
21751 
21752 Whether fagged by the three days’ running chase, and the resistance to
21753 his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some
21754 latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White
21755 Whale’s way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly
21756 nearing him once more; though indeed the whale’s last start had not
21757 been so long a one as before. And still as Ahab glided over the waves
21758 the unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to
21759 the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades
21760 became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at
21761 almost every dip.
21762 
21763 “Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars. Pull
21764 on! ’tis the better rest, the shark’s jaw than the yielding water.”
21765 
21766 “But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!”
21767 
21768 “They will last long enough! pull on!—But who can tell”—he
21769 muttered—“whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on
21770 Ahab?—But pull on! Aye, all alive, now—we near him. The helm! take the
21771 helm! let me pass,”—and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward
21772 to the bows of the still flying boat.
21773 
21774 At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along with
21775 the White Whale’s flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its
21776 advance—as the whale sometimes will—and Ahab was fairly within the
21777 smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale’s spout, curled
21778 round his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,
21779 with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the
21780 poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the
21781 hated whale. As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked
21782 into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his
21783 nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so
21784 suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated
21785 part of the gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once more have
21786 been tossed into the sea. As it was, three of the oarsmen—who foreknew
21787 not the precise instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for
21788 its effects—these were flung out; but so fell, that, in an instant two
21789 of them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a
21790 combing wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man
21791 helplessly dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.
21792 
21793 Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,
21794 instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering
21795 sea. But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with
21796 the line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on their
21797 seats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the treacherous line
21798 felt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!
21799 
21800 “What breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!—’tis whole again; oars! oars!
21801 Burst in upon him!”
21802 
21803 Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled
21804 round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution,
21805 catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing
21806 in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking it—it may be—a
21807 larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing
21808 prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.
21809 
21810 Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. “I grow blind; hands!
21811 stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way. Is’t night?”
21812 
21813 “The whale! The ship!” cried the cringing oarsmen.
21814 
21815 “Oars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for
21816 ever too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! I
21817 see: the ship! the ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?”
21818 
21819 But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the
21820 sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks
21821 burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat
21822 lay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew,
21823 trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water.
21824 
21825 Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego’s mast-head hammer
21826 remained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him as
21827 with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own
21828 forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the
21829 bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon
21830 as he.
21831 
21832 “The whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers of
21833 air, now hug me close! Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a
21834 woman’s fainting fit. Up helm, I say—ye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is
21835 this the end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long fidelities?
21836 Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up
21837 helm again! He turns to meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on
21838 towards one, whose duty tells him he cannot depart. My God, stand by me
21839 now!”
21840 
21841 “Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now
21842 help Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here. I grin at thee, thou grinning
21843 whale! Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but Stubb’s own
21844 unwinking eye? And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is
21845 all too soft; would it were stuffed with brushwood! I grin at thee,
21846 thou grinning whale! Look ye, sun, moon, and stars! I call ye assassins
21847 of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost. For all that, I would
21848 yet ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand the cup! Oh, oh! oh, oh!
21849 thou grinning whale, but there’ll be plenty of gulping soon! Why fly ye
21850 not, O Ahab! For me, off shoes and jacket to it; let Stubb die in his
21851 drawers! A most mouldy and over salted death, though;—cherries!
21852 cherries! cherries! Oh, Flask, for one red cherry ere we die!”
21853 
21854 “Cherries? I only wish that we were where they grow. Oh, Stubb, I hope
21855 my poor mother’s drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers will
21856 now come to her, for the voyage is up.”
21857 
21858 From the ship’s bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive; hammers,
21859 bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in their
21860 hands, just as they had darted from their various employments; all
21861 their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which from side to side
21862 strangely vibrating his predestinating head, sent a broad band of
21863 overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed. Retribution,
21864 swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of
21865 all that mortal man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead
21866 smote the ship’s starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell
21867 flat upon their faces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the
21868 harpooneers aloft shook on their bull-like necks. Through the breach,
21869 they heard the waters pour, as mountain torrents down a flume.
21870 
21871 “The ship! The hearse!—the second hearse!” cried Ahab from the boat;
21872 “its wood could only be American!”
21873 
21874 Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its
21875 keel; but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far
21876 off the other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab’s boat, where, for a
21877 time, he lay quiescent.
21878 
21879 “I turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy
21880 hammer. Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked keel;
21881 and only god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm, and
21882 Pole-pointed prow,—death-glorious ship! must ye then perish, and
21883 without me? Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest
21884 shipwrecked captains? Oh, lonely death on lonely life! Oh, now I feel
21885 my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from all your
21886 furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole foregone
21887 life, and top this one piled comber of my death! Towards thee I roll,
21888 thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with
21889 thee; from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit my last
21890 breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool!
21891 and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still
21892 chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! _Thus_, I give up
21893 the spear!”
21894 
21895 The harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with igniting
21896 velocity the line ran through the grooves;—ran foul. Ahab stooped to
21897 clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him round the
21898 neck, and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was
21899 shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone. Next instant, the
21900 heavy eye-splice in the rope’s final end flew out of the stark-empty
21901 tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in its
21902 depths.
21903 
21904 For an instant, the tranced boat’s crew stood still; then turned. “The
21905 ship? Great God, where is the ship?” Soon they through dim, bewildering
21906 mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous Fata
21907 Morgana; only the uppermost masts out of water; while fixed by
21908 infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the
21909 pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea.
21910 And now, concentric circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its
21911 crew, and each floating oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning,
21912 animate and inanimate, all round and round in one vortex, carried the
21913 smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight.
21914 
21915 But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the
21916 sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the
21917 erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag,
21918 which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying
21919 billows they almost touched;—at that instant, a red arm and a hammer
21920 hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing the
21921 flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar. A sky-hawk that
21922 tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home
21923 among the stars, pecking at the flag, and incommoding Tashtego there;
21924 this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between
21925 the hammer and the wood; and simultaneously feeling that etherial
21926 thrill, the submerged savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his
21927 hammer frozen there; and so the bird of heaven, with archangelic
21928 shrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive
21929 form folded in the flag of Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like
21930 Satan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of
21931 heaven along with her, and helmeted herself with it.
21932 
21933 Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen
21934 white surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the
21935 great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.
21936

21938 Epilogue

21940 “AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE” Job.
21941 
21942 The drama’s done. Why then here does any one step forth?—Because one
21943 did survive the wreck.
21944 
21945 It so chanced, that after the Parsee’s disappearance, I was he whom the
21946 Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab’s bowsman, when that bowsman
21947 assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three
21948 men were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So,
21949 floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it,
21950 when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but
21951 slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had
21952 subsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting
21953 towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly
21954 wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that
21955 vital centre, the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by
21956 reason of its cunning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising
21957 with great force, the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea,
21958 fell over, and floated by my side. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost
21959 one whole day and night, I floated on a soft and dirgelike main. The
21960 unharming sharks, they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths;
21961 the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks. On the second day, a
21962 sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last. It was the
21963 devious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after her missing
21964 children, only found another orphan.

22226 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
22227 
22228 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
22229 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
22230 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
22231 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
22232 people in all walks of life.
22233 
22234 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
22235 assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s
22236 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain
22237 freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
22238 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
22239 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

22269 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
22270 Literary Archive Foundation
22271 
22272 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
22273 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
22274 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
22275 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
22276 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
22277 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
22278 status with the IRS.
22279 
22280 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
22281 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
22282 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
22283 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
22284 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
22285 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND
22286 DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
22287 state visit http://pglaf.org
22288 
22289 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
22290 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
22291 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
22292 approach us with offers to donate.
22293 
22294 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
22295 statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
22296 the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
22297 
22298 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
22299 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
22300 ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
22301 donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

22304 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
22305 works.
22306 
22307 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
22308 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
22309 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
22310 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
22311 
22312 
22313 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
22314 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
22315 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
22316 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
