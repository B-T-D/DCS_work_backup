# 2020-03-28 18:37 : Not clear what the book is getting at here.
#   seems like it's largely  giving you the answer in the "example" under
#   3.4.2 prompt, and just wants the student to practice commenting and writing
#   docstrings? But even that's not clear. Skipping. 

# Copied from exercise 2.4.13 solutions code madlib.py:
adj1 = input('Adjective: ')
noun1 = input('Noun: ')
noun2 = input('Noun: ')
adj2 = input('Adjective: ')
noun3 = input('Noun: ')
    
print('How to Throw a Party')
print()
print('If you are looking for a/an', adj1, 'way to')
print('celebrate your love of', noun1 + ', how about a')
print(noun2 + '-themed costume party?  Start by')
print('sending invitations encoded in', adj2, 'format')
print('giving directions to the location of your', noun3 + '.')
